Today marks a big day for U S large cap technology stocks and Google parent Alphabet Inc NASDAQ will be among the companies at center stage Year to date GOOGL stock is about 12 higher and it marginally pushed to fresh all time intraday highs Wednesday just ahead of Thursday s Q1 earnings report Some traders say momentum is on Alphabet s side Others say the upside momo is exhausted I see a better trading opportunity likely arising on Friday April 28 once the initial reaction to the earnings news has run its course But before we look at the possible trade setups in GOOGL let me be clear that I m a long term believer in Alphabet as a continuing growth story and innovator in technology As such any trade ideas for the near to intermediate term whether long or short should be considered separate from a longer term bullish view When I last discussed Alphabet stock on March 8 I pointed to a bullish setup in which the stock was coiling up for a pop I gave a near term upside target in the 870 880 range Seven trading days later the stock traded as high as 874 tagging the middle of my upside target range where at least partial profit taking was in order And as I discussed yesterday what GOOGL does along with Amazon com Inc NASDAQ Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ and other big tech names reporting tonight should have a lot of pull on the Nasdaq 100 and other large stock indices Now we look at the charts and look ahead On the multiyear chart we see that Alphabet still is ascending at an impressive rate and thus in a steep and steepening slope The rally over the past two weeks has once again brought the stock back to the very upper end of its ascending wedge like formation purple dotted lines From where I sit it s difficult to imagine much more sustainable upside from here At least not before GOOGL stock settles into a new consolidation period
