Either Wall Street is wildly enthusiastic about the future prospects of Tesla Inc NASDAQ TSLA or pessimistic about Ford Motor Co s NYSE F It could be some mix of the two that has brought Tesla s market cap of 43 billion which is 88 of Ford s 49 billion The contrast in size between the two is massive Tesla barely produced 83 000 cars last year Ford produced over 6 6 million Even if Tesla hits its near term forecasts its production will barely top 500 000 in two years Tesla claims it is on the cutting edge of not just electric cars but also self driving vehicles Ford last year announced it would invest 1 billion in Argo AI a venture that also includes Uber and Google This is only one Ford initiative Last year Ford said it would build autonomous cars for ride sharing and that production levels would be significant As it made this announcement management said If the world of self driving and autonomous cars comes as quickly as optimistic experts suggest Ford has two problems The first is that the electric car and self driving car sectors are crowded with at least two dozen major start ups and every large car company in the world There is not a single guarantee Ford will be in the vanguard of this work If not it will have spent billions of dollars and not taken a leader s position Ironically Ford s other problem may be its legacy business which is the development production and sales of those 6 6 million cars The vast majority of them are gasoline driven and configured to be driven by humans Reconfiguring a company for the future when it is as big as Ford may be nearly impossible Tesla maybe overvalued There is certainly a case to be made that is true However its stock price was about what it is today in both August 2014 and June 2015 Its market cap level is resilient Ford s stock price story is less attractive by a wide margin Over the past two years its stock has fallen 23 to 12 50 Over the same period Tesla s has risen 32 to 269 The S P 500 is up 11 in that time The Tesla and Ford market cap gap is not a fluke
