in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date June 21 2016 through June 30 2016 as the impact was immaterial During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded a decrease of 255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option resulting in the recognition of non cash non operating income that we do not believe is indicative of our operating performance As such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the prior period presented This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision There was no comparable adjustment recorded for the three months ended December 31 2016 Adjusted net income effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share are non GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U S GAAP The following table reconciles our as reported net income effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share which are calculated in accordance with U S GAAP to our respective non GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three months ended December 31 2015 1 Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding Effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers Our fiscal full year 2017 annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth outlook is based on adjusted non GAAP fiscal full year 2016 results which are reconciled to their closest comparable U S GAAP financial measure below Our financial results during the twelve months ended September 30 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance as they are either non recurring or have no cash impact As such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented Severance cost In the fiscal fourth quarter we recorded a 110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe Although we routinely record severance expenses these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe Net of related tax benefit of 38 million determined by applying applicable tax rates the adjustment to net income was an increase of 72 million Remeasurement of deferred tax liability In September 2016 we recorded a non cash non recurring 88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom Acquisition related costs During the twelve months ended September 30 2016 we incurred 152 million of non recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction This amount is comprised of 60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees and 92 million of U K stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses Net of related tax benefit of 56 million determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates the adjustment to net income was an increase of 96 million Visa Europe Framework

Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe Net of related tax benefit of 693 million determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates the adjustment to net income was an increase of 1 2 billion Net gains on currency forward contracts During the twelve months ended September 30 2016 we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition As a result we recorded non recurring net gains of 74 million before tax in other non operating income Net of related tax expense of 27 million determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates the adjustment to net income was a decrease of 47 million Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits During the twelve months ended September 30 2016 we recorded a non recurring foreign exchange gain of 145 million before tax in other non operating income as a result of holding euro denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing date of the Visa Europe transaction Net of related tax expense of 54 million determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates the impact to net income was a decrease of 91 million Revaluation of Visa Europe put option During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded a decrease of 255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option resulting in the recognition of non cash income in other non operating income This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on the reported income tax provision Adjusted operating expenses operating margin non operating income expense income before income taxes income taxes effective income tax rate net income and diluted earnings per share are non
