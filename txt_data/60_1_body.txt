Shares of mobile payment company Square Inc NYSE SQ jumped as much as 18 in trading Thursday after the company reported fourth quarter earnings At 12 10 p m EST shares were up 13 2 on the day Square reported a 21 increase in revenue to 452 million in the fourth quarter and a 43 increase in adjusted revenue to 192 million The company still lost 15 million or 0 04 per share but EBITDA for the quarter was 30 million the most since becoming a public company Analysts were only expecting 449 8 million in revenue and a 0 09 loss per share so results topped that bar by a wide margin And guidance of 880 million to 900 million of adjusted revenue and adjusted net income of 0 15 to 0 19 per share in 2017 which came in ahead of expectations The hope for Square is to be able to build a platform small companies can use as a foundation and continually add customers to that base while operating costs grow more slowly That strategy played out nicely in the fourth quarter and management expects more momentum in 2017 I don t think there s anything stopping mobile payments from taking over the payment market and Square is a leader in the space This is a stock with a bright future and the improving financials are another sign that Square is on the right path
