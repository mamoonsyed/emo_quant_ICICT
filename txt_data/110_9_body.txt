Twitter Inc NYSE shares are on the move Buyers are swarming this morning sending the blue bird higher by over 6 As always the Twittersphere is rife with speculation about who might be putting in a phantom buyout bid now Whatever the reason though the pop is breathing new life into TWTR stock at just right time That s because Twitter was on the verge of giving back the lion s share of its gains acquired during the late April ramp As a self professed chart watcher I must say Twitter boasts one of the messiest charts on the Street It s been jumping around like a jackrabbit and altogether unable to settle into a sustainable trend Just when a downtrend begins to take root buyout speculation sends TWTR stock to the moon Then when a potential uptrend finally sprouts the failure of said rumor or another disappointment delivers a swift kick to the keister sending the stock right back down With that lengthy disclaimer out of the way today s surge has carried Twitter stock back into bullish territory It now rests above the 20 day 50 day and 200 day moving averages Time will tell if it sticks but buyers have definitely established a foothold The stock has room to run until its next resistance level near 18 75 While we re only one hour into the day volume has already surpassed yesterday s entire trading session so we re seeing a massive amount of participation here By the closing bell we should have quite the accumulation day Clearly you re too late for the initial pop here but that doesn t mean you can t latch on for a second wind Let s check out a trade that s best fit for speculatin If you re looking for a low cost limited risk avenue for betting on further upside then long calls are worth a shot Implied volatility remains subdued so options can be scooped up on the cheap Buy the Aug 17 calls for 1 80 or better The initial cost represents the maximum risk and will be forfeited if TWTR stock rests below 17 at expiration The max reward is unlimited so pull out the pom poms and root for the blue bird to score some monster follow through As of this writing Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities
