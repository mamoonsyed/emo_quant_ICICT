Here s two odd winners from the quarter Square SQ and Twitter TWTR I know I have been adamant that Jack Dorsey who runs both should spent more time at one or the other Sometimes I think he is more passionate about Square than Twitter That might be the case after last night s quarter because it is creating its own small business ecosystem for retailers and restaurants everything from the register to tide over loans to delivery I know from Bar San Miguel where we are prepping for our big Cinco de Mayo event that we swear by Square because it s basically our credit card register and our delivery system in an era where we have to have delivery even if we don t want to That s the same theory as my Grubhub GRUB piece earlier this week People want to be at home Twitter We have seen an acceleration in monthly average users and an acceleration in ads The new programming is very meaningful including the pick up of Bloomberg Of course the President never hurts with his principal method of communication being Tweets I think it is worth noting that Jack has some pretty powerful people who speak for the company namely Sarah Friar the CFO of Square and Anthony Noto the chief operating officer of Twitter They are getting it done Twitter can go higher and I say that not just because Mark Cuban is buying shares Square just has the momentum of small business payment processing and loan advances on its side When Square was much lower I was concerned about the riskiness of the advances that Square offers small businesses but the team there convinced me that because they have access to how much is taken in every day these advances are about as safe as they can get They both can work higher
