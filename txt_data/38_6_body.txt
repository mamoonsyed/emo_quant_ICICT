Ryzen is here AMD said Wednesday that it plans a hard launch of its first three Ryzen processors on March 2 The highly anticipated chips promise to outperform high end parts from Intel and undercut their prices by as much as 54 percent AMD executives confidently unveiled the first three desktop chips to attack Intel s Core i7 supported by several top tier motherboard vendors and boutique system builders In many cases executives said AMD will offer more for less as early Ryzen benchmarks prove The top tier Ryzen 7 1800X will cost less than half of what Intel s thousand dollar Core i7 6900K chip does and outperform it too You can preorder Ryzen chips and systems from 180 retailers and system integrators today Like Intel AMD s Ryzen offerings consist of three new chip families the premium Ryzen 7 the midrange Ryzen 5 and the cheapest Ryzen 3 AMD is rolling out its fastest premium Ryzen 7 chips first including the Ryzen 7 1800X 499 the Ryzen 7 1700X 399 and Ryzen 7 1700 329 AMD s Ryzen 5 and the Ryzen 3 will ship later this year at the moment AMD s not saying exactly when Why this matters About the only major aspect of Ryzen that AMD hadn t yet disclosed was its price and availability Analysts say AMD appears to have done its homework leaving Intel in danger of giving up market share in the bread and butter PC microprocessors that built its company But Intel has its ways Possible responses include price cuts additional chips with more cores and promoting its new Optane technology they said Unlike Intel s massive January launch of more than 40 Kaby Lake chips AMD s playing it slow Here are more details on the three new Ryzen 7 chips AMD s Ryzen 7 1800X a 95 watt part boasts 8 cores and 16 threads It runs at 3 6GHz and will boost to 4GHz AMD chief executive Lisa Su said When AMD s 499 chip matched up against the eight core Intel Core i7 6900K a 1 089 part the 1800X recorded an identical single thread score of 162 on the Cinebench benchmark But when all of its cores were turned on the 1800X outperformed the 6900K by 9 percent recording a score of 1 601 The 1800X is the fastest eight core processor on the market Su said AMD s Ryzen 7 1700X a 95 watt 8 core 16 thread chip runs at 3 4GHz and boosts to 3 8GHz Using the multicore Cinebench benchmark the 399 1700X scored 1 537 4 percent faster than the 1 089 Core i7 6900K chip AMD s Ryzen 7 1700 consumes up to 65 watts and runs at 3GHz boosting to 3 7GHz It too includes 8 cores and 16 threads According to AMD s own tests it recorded a score of 1 410 on the multicore Cinebench test a whopping 46 percent better than the 339 Core i7 7700K Using the Handbrake video encoding test the R7 1700 finished in 61 8 seconds AMD said versus 71 8 seconds for the 7700K According to AMD the Ryzen 1700 will be packaged with a new Wraith Spire cooler which will run at 32 decibels The other two Ryzen chips will not AMD also confirmed the Wraith Stealth cooler too Ryzen s apparently strong performance is due to an overachieving design team For more on AMD s Zen architecture and its features see our earlier story AMD said early on that one of its goals was to increase Zen s instructions per clock IPC a measure of its performance efficiency by 40 percent In fact Su said AMD achieved a 52 percent IPC improvement We not only beat our goal we beat it by a lot Su said All three chips will be supported by motherboards from ASRock Asus Biostar Gigabyte and MSI 82 different boards in all AMD said They ll be based on the AM4 platform and AMD s X370 and B350 chipsets At launch 19 elite builders per AMD are expected to debut Ryzen systems with a total of 200 expected during the first quarter PC towers designed for gaming from top hardware makers are also coming during the same period AMD said Next up Radeon Vega AMD s next gen PC graphics solution scheduled to launch in the second quarter Su reiterated that she believes AMD will have adequate supplies of Ryzen on hand to meet customer demand a claim that Moor Insights analyst Pat Moorhead says he s confirmed So far talking to the partners here it sounds pretty good Moorhead said They re telling me that they re getting the volumes that they want to get when they expect to get them And that s good AMD believes that Intel s rested on its laurels delivering a series of minor improvements year in and year out To its credit however Intel has maintained operating profits even as it negotiates a gradual shift away from a shrinking PC market by prioritizing profitable high end PC processors With Ryzen AMD sees an opportunity to steal some of that high margin share Intel however has several opportunities to respond including simply lowering its prices Intel s latest official processor price list remains unchanged since early January Still as Moor Insight s Moorhead pointed out AMD has a lot more to lose than Intel has to gain by a price move The way that I think Intel will react is to say let s see if this is for real and determine what Ryzen s performance actually is Moorhead said But they might have two or three things in the hopper he added including pushing single threaded chips like the Core i3 and adding additional cores to its existing lineup The third option is Optane Intel s super speedy storage technology which Intel could use to pooh pooh CPU performance and push system level improvements Adding cores seems most likely however With the exception of the 6900K as well as its eight and ten core Extreme Edition chips Intel s Core i7 chips top out at six cores compared to eight for AMD s Ryzen AMD has a core advantage and eventually I am expecting AMD to layer in cores Moorhead said A statement from Intel meanwhile provided a fourth alternative sowing dissent via a tried and true PR strategy known as fear uncertainty and doubt We take any competition seriously but as we ve learned consumers usually take a wait and see approach on performance claims for untested products Intel said in a statement Seventh gen Intel Core delivers the best experiences and with 8th gen Intel Core and new technologies like Intel Optane memory coming soon Intel will not stop raising the bar Until Ryzen chips become available for benchmarking we won t know for sure how well the Ryzen will compete For now though anticipation is running high Nathan Brookwood an analyst with Insight 64 said Ryzen is clearly the most competitive chip they ve fielded in a decade a statement that Moor Insight s Moorhead an AMD veteran echoed Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds noted that AMD has extended the single core performance that Intel itself offers over eight cores with high memory bandwidth to boot AMD s Su had a simpler take The best starts now she said Updated at 10 07 AM with additional
