Alphabet GOOG GOOGL reported earnings for the second quarter of 2017 on Monday July 25 Market reaction to the announcement was quite pessimistic with the stock falling by over 3 after hours It s hard to tell how the stock price will fluctuate over the coming days and weeks but one thing looks quite clear to me Alphabet remains a rock solid business and there is no reason to sell after the recent earnings announcement On the contrary short term weakness may create a buying opportunity for long term investors Mobile advertising is a major growth driver for Google and this is impacting some important metrics Traffic acquisition costs TAC are rising and cost per click CPC is trending downwards over the past several years In this context TAC to network members increased from 21 to 22 of total Google advertising revenue last quarter and aggregate CPC declined 23 versus the second quarter in 2016 The online advertising industry is evolving and this has inevitable consequences for all companies in the sector Nevertheless Google is still doing better than fine Aggregate paid clicks increased by an impressive 52 year over year and Google produced 25 8 billion in revenue during the quarter a healthy increase of 21 The main point is that Google is more than compensating for falling ad prices with massive growth in volume and revenue growth rates continue to impress especially considering the size of the business At the whole company level Alphabet delivered both revenue and earnings numbers above Wall Street expectations Total revenue reached 26 billion growing by 21 in U S dollars and increasing 23 in constant currency terms Operating income excluding the fine from the European Commission was 6 87 billion during the period or 26 of revenue Adjusted earnings per share excluding the fine was 8 9 per unit a big increase of 27 versus 7 per share in the second quarter of 2016 The fine from the European Commission is a one time event that won t affect Alphabet s ability to generate value for shareholders over the long term In any case even if we take it at full value the 2 7 billion fine is roughly 0 4 of Alphabet s market capitalization and it was already old news leading to the report so it s hard to blame the post earnings market reaction to the fine Alphabet s financial performance during the quarter was much healthier than what market reaction indicates Besides the main fundamental drivers behind those numbers are stronger than ever Revenues from Other Bets reached 248 million last quarter primarily generated by Nest Fiber and Verily This is a vigorous increase of more than 34 year over year Wall Street analysts are on average forecasting that Alphabet will make 40 12 in earnings per share during 2018 this puts the company at a fairly reasonable price to earnings ratio of 24 As a reference the average company in the S P 500 trades at a lower forward price to earnings ratio around 18 However the average company in the index is no match to Alphabet in terms of financial performance According to data from FactSet the average growth rates for companies in the S P 500 are 5 in revenue and 7 2 in earnings Alphabet on the other hand is growing both sales and earnings at more than 20 year over year Besides financial soundness is unquestionable when it comes to Alphabet as the company is sitting on massive amounts of cash on its balance sheet The tech juggernaut ended the second quarter with 94 7 billion in cash and marketable securities this is approximately 14 versus Alphabet s market capitalization The long term growth story in Alphabet remains intact TAC and CPC are important variables to watch going forward however as long as the company keeps producing solid growth in revenue and earnings investors should not miss the forest for the trees Alphabet is an outstanding high quality business and the stock was already reasonably priced before the earnings announcement The lower the price goes as a reaction to earnings the bigger the opportunity for long term investors
