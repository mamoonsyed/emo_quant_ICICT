Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ released its fiscal third quarter report after Thursday s bell and the tepid response in QCOM stock tells you all you need to know about the lackluster results Qualcomm shares are off 3 in early after market trading putting the stock s year to date losses at about 16 This comes in stark contrast to major rallies across tech including even old line operators such as Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ SAP SE ADR NYSE and Oracle Corporation NYSE The company did record a beat on both the top and bottom lines Qualcomm earnings of 83 cents per share of QCOM stock were two pennies better than the consensus and revenues of 5 3 billion were able to squeeze past Wall Street s estimate of 5 3 billion But it s important to keep in mind that back in late April QCOM lowered its guidance for the quarter because of the adverse impact of litigation from Apple Inc NASDAQ so the bar already was low Guidance was the real trouble spot Qualcomm is forecasting earnings of 75 cents to 85 cents per share versus the consensus of 93 cents and revenues are expected to range from 5 4 billion to 6 2 billion compared to Wall Street s 5 51 billion Technically speaking Qualcomm could be in a bit of trouble should Wednesday s after market returns hold The early dip in QCOM stock has brought shares below the 50 day moving average around 56 which is acting as support while shares test overhead resistance at the 50 day moving average Should Qualcomm break below the 56 threshold there s also price support around 54 75 then after that the 52 area QCOM toyed with in April that would be another 8 from Thursday s close As for the fundamentals QCOM stock does have a reasonable valuation with a forward price to earnings ratio of about 15 and a dividend yield around 4 one of the highest yields among large cap tech But those factors don t seem as attractive right now Qualcomm s key issues is legal uncertainty Back in January AAPL lobbed a 1 billion suit against the company for unfair practices with the licensing of its technologies which is the core of the QCOM s business it represents about 80 of the operating income In other words if a legal action invalidates the patent protection shares likely would come under tremendous pressure As should be no surprise Apple is playing hardball such as ordering suppliers to suspend royalty payments The company also bolstered its lawsuit ahead of the Qualcomm earnings report by bringing other phone makers into the litigation and will even cover any fees Already QCOM has estimated that there could be a grueling 31 to 41 drop in licensing revenues Qualcomm is fighting back and the company has a long history of effectively defending its intellectual property What s more QCOM is pushing hard to diversify its business such as with the acquisition of NXP Semicondutors as well as the moves into emerging growth areas like the Internet of Things But the Apple effect is tough to ignore The company seems intent on finding any way to lower its licensing costs and it certainly has the resources to wage an intense battle Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and operates PathwayTax com which provides year round tax services Follow him on Twitter at ttaulli As of this writing he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities
