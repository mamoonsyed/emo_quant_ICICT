Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that s taken over our lives But somehow I ve always associated Samsung s Galaxy Note 8 with being a phone for power users who need it for business rather than young lovers who need it to seem more alluring Yet here s Samsung with an ad for the Note 8 which debuted on Friday that is all heart We re at a party A young woman is using her S Pen to say hello to a young man with a Live Message Oddly he s sitting only a few feet from her Which might incite the question Why doesn t she just go over and talk to him Her S Pen greeting goes well The young man sidles over Warm feelings blossom They appear to go on dates Well at least one The rest of the time they re using their Note 8s to send each other imaginative messages of affection And then sitting in the back of a Lyft It must be a Lyft She s too thoughtful to use Uber the woman is overcome with a deep feeling It s so deep that she has to express it via her Note 8 rather than say wait until she sees her lover again She tells him that she thinks she loves him As for his response I ll leave you to decide whether it s charming or the typical sort of marginally aloof thing you d expect from a tech era millennial I wonder if they ll stand across from each other and send each other their marriage vows through Live Messages too Please don t worry the vows would be projected on a screen above the altar for everyone to see and admire Technically Incorrect Bringing you a fresh and irreverent take on tech
