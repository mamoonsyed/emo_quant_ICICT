With the disaster that was the Galaxy Note 7 it was unclear whether Samsung would ever launch another device carrying the Note name But it look like we are going to get a Galaxy Note 8 reportedly in August A person not authorized to speak publicly on the matter tells Reuters that we can expect a Galaxy Note 8 launch in New York City in the second half of August The Note 7 launched on Friday August 19 last year As to what we can expect to see the same person talking to Reuters said the Note 8 will include a curved display just like the Galaxy S8 but that it will be marginally larger than the 6 2 inch display found on the Galaxy S8 We should also expect to see two cameras on the back of the smartphone Samsung confirmed it s working on a Note 8 in October as part of an announcement stating the company was still committed to the Note line And Samsung could do with the sales boost if it ships a fault free Note 8 as the Galaxy S8 is thought to have had no major impact on Samsung s sales If the launch is happening in August then we won t have to wait long Samsung sent out the invites for the Galaxy S8 launch a month before the event so expect the Note 8 event invites to appear in a month or so Samsung blamed bad batteries for the disaster that was the Galaxy Note 7 but the smartphone did return as refurbished rentals If the Note 8 is going to be a success Samsung needs to produce as near to perfect a handset as possible Even minor faults will be jumped on by the media and could result in the Note brand becoming forever toxic with consumers
