It s still not too late to buy into a very friendly looking trend off and on the price chart of Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ MSFT But with earnings around the corner a fully hedged collar position on MSFT stock continues to make a good deal of sense Let me explain Microsoft reports late next week and as InvestorPlace s Josh Enomoto notes boring Microsoft stock is still a must have That s not to say Microsoft can t move lower If it did though I d likely view the decline as a buy on weakness opportunity as that boring stock is also trending well off and on the price chart Bottom line MSFT stock has a lot going for it starting with a 2 2 dividend And with revenue generation now evenly split between old growth and new growth markets and sales continuing to look favorable as Microsoft increases its reach in cloud computing and artificial intelligence shares look even more appealing Lastly factor in an equally trendy but far from over the top Microsoft stock chart and it s still not too late to buy into Microsoft Version 2 0 Click to EnlargeLooking at the weekly chart of Microsoft stock there s not a lot to add since I last wrote about the stock about two months ago Back then I gave MSFT s staunch bullish trend a technical thumbs up Today all I can honestly add is say Happy Anniversary The fact is it has been exactly one year since MSFT stock finally cleared the prior century s high water mark set during the Dot bomb era And following a small and tight bout of indecision by investors clearing that technical hurdle began a very strong shift in bullish price momentum Technically this could be cause for some corrective profit taking especially with shares up about 30 since clearing prior highs And with earnings next week surely those thoughts have crossed the minds of some investors However given how long it took MSFT to make new highs and the much more confident behavior being only a year old this is still a friendly looking trend With that said I have an eye on fresh highs and see any potential price weakness as opportunistic for bullish investors
