Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO reported its fiscal second quarter results after the market closed on Feb 15 Revenue declined as the core switching and routing businesses performed poorly and growth businesses such as collaboration and security were unable to fully offset that weakness An 11 5 dividend boost and guidance that calls for a slightly better third quarter provided some good news amid otherwise lackluster results Revenue slumped as both the switching and routing segments posted weak numbers but the bottom line held up on an adjusted basis Cisco expects a smaller revenue decline during the third quarter Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins talked up the company s acquisition of AppDynamics We are pleased with the quarter and the continued customer momentum as we help them drive security automation and intelligence across the network and into the cloud This quarter we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics which combined with Cisco s networking analytics will provide customers with unprecedented insights into business performance We will remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio as we continue to deliver value to customers and shareholders CFO Kelly Kramer discussed the company s progress and its dividend increase We delivered a solid Q2 with 11 6 billion in revenues and further growth in key business areas of collaboration security and services I am pleased with our progress on business transformation to software and recurring revenues We expect to continue to execute well and return value to our shareholders including our board approved an increase of three cents to the quarterly dividend to 0 29 per share Cisco s core switching and routing businesses were weak during the third quarter and the company s growth businesses were unable to grow fast enough to pick up the slack The shift to subscription software continues to negatively affect Cisco s results with revenue being pushed out into the future Net income dropped considerably but a one time tax benefit during the second quarter of last year was the culprit On a non GAAP basis the bottom line held up well
