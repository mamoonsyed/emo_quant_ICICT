iPhone 7 doing better than the iPhone 6s Hard to say I m currently neutral on Apple NASDAQ AAPL but still follow the stock as Apple exerts a large influence on the entire market through having the largest market capitalization Apple just released its Q1 FY2017 earnings report and I have a large number of observations to make Here we go Before Apple reported I was actually surprised at how undemanding the revenue consensus was 2 0 There were no news of in quarter iPhone 7 weakness going into the print plus Unsurprisingly Apple beat the revenue consensus But it didn t beat it by much and the guidance for next quarter was actually pretty weak Not just was guidance below the existing consensus but it implies a sequential revenue drop of 33 this year versus 33 3 last year or nearly the same Last year Q2 FY2016 s report was seen as very weak and actually led to a significant sell off in Apple shares All of this said we re now approaching the moment where the iPhone 8 will start being leaked We can expect the first realistic leaks around mid March Apple is likely to already be trading under the influence as the market is buying a super cycle plus I expect Apple to try and wring higher prices from its customers just like Samsung and Google seem set to do Putting it all together this all seems very neutral to me Not warranting much of a rally and not warranting much of a sell off either Come mid March and just from the first iPhone 8 leaks we should have a better perspective on how Apple stands to do After all this earnings report just continued to confirm that Apple is the iPhone and wherever the iPhone goes so will the stock price
