As the old saying goes if you play with fire sooner or later you re going to get burned All the recent newcomers to Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ are feeling the sting today with AMD stock tumbling on heels of a concerning downgrade from Barclays In short the research arm of the British bank doesn t see despite all the recent hype that Advanced Micro Devices is actually gaining any market share Is Barclays right Has AMD stock gained nearly 400 since the end of 2015 on nothing more than wishful thinking That may be an overly pessimistic way of putting it in that Advanced Micro Devices is far better off today than it was a year ago On the other hand Barclays makes a good point Advanced Micro Devices once was a powerhouse name that was fiercely competitive with Intel Corporation NASDAQ on the CPU computer processor front as well as hold its own against rival Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ on the GPU graphics processing front However it slowly ceded ground in both markets as its hardware just didn t remain as marketable as it needed to That has changed of late Largely driven by relatively new CEO Lisa Su who took the helm in late 2014 AMD has been developing new products hoped to win back market share Its Ryzen CPU was and still is a head turning processor and its new Vega GPU hardware is impressive to say the least It was the company s most recent GPU evolution in fact that delivered a bonus surprise It s ideally suited to help mine for cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum aren t exactly new But the business of mining them is a relatively new industry It hasn t been until the past few months that the right people realized that GPUs which are capable of performing more simultaneous calculations than a CPU are better equipped to look for the one of a kind digital thread that makes up one unit of a cryptocurrency Mining banks are now being established on a regular basis with their organizers expected to compute their way to riches before anyone else unlocks those code coins AMD s graphical processing units are the weapon of choice for many of those speculators The rise of digital currency mining and the launch of Ryzen and Vega have put AMD stock in a spotlight for the first time in a long time to be sure Barclays has a point though There s still no conclusive evidence that Advanced Micro is winning back new market share on a permanent basis To be fair Ryzen had a strong inaugural quarter in Q2 reportedly claiming 10 4 of the CPU market that has been long dominated by Intel But take that success with a grain of salt
