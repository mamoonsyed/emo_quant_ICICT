On a poll I posted on my Value Stocks Journal on September 28 readers overwhelmingly agreed that Advanced Micro Devices AMD is a buy ahead of earnings later this month For short term traders the quarterly report will seem like an eternity away but for investors chances are good AMD will affirm its recovery is well underway Investors are now mulling with difficulty over buying AMD stock ahead of earnings Since August AMD s stock is stuck in a tight range of between 12 13 a share Buying AMD at 12 and selling at 13 is a strategy that worked Of the 31 readers responding 28 agreed AMD is an attractive stock compared to 3 who disagreed Sales at a German retailer Mindfactory continued to trend favorably for AMD though Intel INTC still commands the market in sales by revenue Sales of Intel s i7 7700K CPU continued to shrink purple bar AMD s mainstream processors the r5 1600 and r5 1600X held ground More impressive is the surge in r7 1700X sales since July striped green bars On a per unit basis AMD s r5 1600 and 1600X both held steady The numbers show that Intel is slowly losing some market share to AMD thanks mostly to the Ryzen r5 and less so from the r7 It should come as no surprise that Intel s i7 7700K is the most popular processor even though Ryzen sales are taking some of its sales Intel chips come with Integrated Graphics or iGPUs which negate the need for consumers to buy a separate graphics card AMD will fill the gap here with its Ryzen APUs Already the budget r3 processor is showing traction in the markets At low price points and having GPU support AMD s APUs should add meaningfully to AMD s sales The company will very likely release a four core eight thread APU having Vega graphics in the future To narrow the gap between current version Intel CPUs and Ryzen Intel is refreshing its processors with Coffee Lake As it did in the past to beat AMD the chip giant will offer faster single core performance on Coffee Lake A full benchmark leak shows the i7 8700K may run at 4 8 GHz on air Thought competition heating up for AMD s Ryzen the impact of Intel s CPU refresh will not show up in AMD s quarterly results Chances are good that sales of Ryzen 3 did well while Ryzen 5 sales made up for the bulk of chip sales in the period Volume sales for AMD s iconic Threadripper which costs just 549 for 8 cores and 16 threads will not likely add meaningfully to the overall results But initial sales should give the company the confidence it needs to raise its guidance on the HEDT processor Intel s comparable offering costs too much giving AMD an edge AMD stock is range bound while Intel s stock closed near a 52 week high at 38 08 on September 29 Vega sales will be one weak point in AMD s quarter Reviews indicate the GPU demands far too much power At its price to performance Vega 64 may have a tough time competing against Nvidia s NVDA GTX 1080 but Vega 56 may have a better shot The GPU offers 90 of Vega 64 s performance at 80 of the price AMD has a good chance of winning consumers who would otherwise buy a GeForce GTX 1070 It may have to adjust prices lower or bundle the product with games Vega s better cryptocurrency mining performance over Nvidia s may keep prices from falling AMD s stock is not cheap from a forward P E perspective of 41 times It clearly remains an investment for those having a multi year time frame Ryzen s rollout is only just picking up steam Ryzen 2 will benefit from the momentum of an established channel from Ryzen 1 Threadripper will outclass Intel s more expensive alternative In the GPU space Vega sales may struggle but should still do well enough to give the quarter a meaningful revenue boost These positive points may be enough to justify buying the stock ahead of the earnings report later this month Please Follow me for continued coverage on value stock ideas Click on my name next to my avatar at the top of the article
