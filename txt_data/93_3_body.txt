Though IBM notched a major earnings beat to close out Q4 of 2016 a temporary jolt in after hours trading quickly gave way to a major decline in share price The company reported non GAAP earnings per share of 5 01 compared to analyst consensus of 4 88 Revenue for the quarter came in at 21 77 billion up from expectations of 21 66 billion Because of the strong quarterly earnings IBM also beat full year estimates posting 13 59 in earnings per share IBM s stock was on the move in after hours trading up more than 4 or about 2 4 in the minutes after reporting But by 4 30 pm ET sellers had their say with the stock down about the same amount at 4 08 or 2 45 as of 4 45 pm ET In a statement about the earnings chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty claimed that the results of the past year established IBM as the industry s leading cognitive solutions and cloud platform company She credited IBM Watson and IBM Blockchain as two areas for growth More and more clients are choosing the IBM Cloud because of its differentiated capabilities which are helping to transform industries such as financial services airlines and retail Rometty added In the group of businesses centered around cloud mobile and analytics that IBM calls its strategic imperatives Big Blue increased revenue by 13 to 32 8 billion for 2016 Cloud revenue itself grew 35 to 13 7 billion The company slightly raised its full year earnings expectations for 2017 to non GAAP EPS of at least 13 80 IBM s segment results were roughly on par with what analysts expected in its Cognitive Solutions group which grew 1 4 and 2 2 in constant currency an expected boost for its IBM Watson unit as it brings in more recurring revenue from scale IBM s consulting business called its Global Business Services meanwhile continued to bleed money with revenue of 4 1 billion a 4 1 or 3 6 loss in constant currency about on par with anticipations Infrastructure services grew modestly at 1 7 or 2 4 in CC while the Systems group of hardware dropped 12 5 or 12 1 in CC at 2 5 billion Why the drop off in the stock despite the beat and Rometty declaring victory in the quarter One explanation could be that revenue despite beating estimates continued to drop for the 19th consecutive quarter Another possible reason could be the impact that one time gains are having on keeping IBM posting earnings beats IBM also benefited from a lower than expected tax rate to beat earnings says Edward Jones analysts Bill Kreher While results benefited from a low tax rate and guidance was not meaningfully above the consensus view we view weakness as a natural pause following price strength over the last year Kreher wrote FORBES on Thursday night In a note before the earnings release Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted that IBM s full year earnings beat was due in part to one time gains in taxes and the sales of intellectual property that Sacconaghi estimated contributed about 1 billion in net income Remove that from IBM s yearly total and the company would have missed by about 1 00 from its full year EPS guidance for 2016 of 13 50 It would be the third consecutive year in which IBM required one time gains to meet guidance the analyst wrote This suggests ongoing changes in the technology landscape continue to be more challenging than IBM appears to be estimating or that IBM is not pivoting as quickly as it expected On a call with analysts after the earnings IBM chief financial officer Martin Schroeter said the company had reached a margin inflection point in 2016 Schroeter also said should IBM grow revenue from strategic imperatives by 10 or 11 IBM would hit 40 billion in revenue from by 2018 a target it set several years ago If IBM did that its strategic imperatives could become the majority of the company s business for the first time Schroeter said such a convergence is possible but not a focus by itself for Big Blue We are focused on driving value in those strategic imperatives not just grabbing a little revenue to have some math work out differently the IBM executive said This story was updated to include input from analyst Bill Kreher and comment from IBM CFO Martin Schroeter
