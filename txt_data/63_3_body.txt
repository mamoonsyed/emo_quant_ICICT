HP NYSE HPQ stock formerly known as Hewlett Packard rose as much as 9 9 in early Thursday trading before settling down to enjoy a more recent gain of 8 7 as of 2 30 p m EST This being earnings season you might expect that earnings had something to do with HP s rise and you d be right HP reported its fiscal Q1 2017 earnings yesterday after close of trading Earnings of 0 36 per share on revenue of 12 7 billion beat Wall Street estimates on both fronts This probably explains why the stock is responding so strongly Compared to the year ago results profits were flat and operating profit margins declined 90 basis points to 6 7 On the other hand at least revenues rose 4 year over year Turning its gaze forward however HP predicted that the second fiscal quarter of 2017 will see profits turn back down to perhaps as low as 0 32 to 0 35 per share This guidance range would appear to fall short of Wall Street expectations for 0 39 per share in Q2 What s more HP s entire guidance range fell below the 0 36 per share that the company earned in last year s Q2 That s not particularly good news yet investors appear to be shrugging it off in light of the earnings beat HP achieved in Q1 Or they may be assuming HP is lowballing its estimates again and hoping for a repeat beat Either way at a P E price to earnings ratio multiple of only 11 times trailing earnings HP stock certainly doesn t seem expensive today Up 9 on Thursday it shouldn t take much more good news to make it go up more
