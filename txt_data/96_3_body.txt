But beware It s the eve of the 30th anniversary of the worst day in stock market history Our view Another day another new high for the Dow Jones industrial average On Wednesday the Dow closed above 23 000 for the first time ending the trading day at 23 158 Just eight and a half years ago in the midst of the Great Recession the Dow closed at mere 6 547 At the time President Obama assumed the role of broker in chief saying that buying stocks is a potentially good deal Was he ever right In the ensuing years the market defied Republican leaning pundits who warned that the policies of the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration would punish stocks More recently it has defied Democratic leaning pundits who said the chaos of the Trump administration would spill into markets OTHER VIEWS Take the Dow credit get the blame What gives here How can stock indexes keep rising for so long even as the news outside seems so bad One obvious explanation is that politics and punditry have far less impact on the stock market than people sometimes think Investors look first to tangible data on corporate profits which have been robust and growing for some time Indeed Wednesday s gains were attributed largely to an upbeat earnings report from IBM a member of the Dow 30 Second they look to indications on which way the economy is likely to head And here too the data back up the optimism After a soft period in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 growth in America has picked up The pickup abroad has been even more encouraging Much of Latin America had been in outright recession but is now recovering Europe is pulling out of economic stagnation And Asian growth is accelerating All this is beneficial for U S exporters For all this good news there are as always reasons to fret Investors have a long history of pushing stocks too high in periods of optimism and too low in moments of despair And when they have a change of sentiment stocks can go on a wild ride Thursday happens to be the 30th anniversary of the worst day in stock market history when the market plunged 22 6 which would be 5 234 points today Right now investors seem to have pushed stocks at least a little on the high side The standard metric a ratio of the average cost of stocks divided by the average profits they bring in is running well above historical averages In addition investors might be overestimating the prospects for a big tax reform measure and underestimating the damage an erratic impulsive president can do A prudent investor should also take note of the long history of markets If there is one thing that is abundantly clear it is that they will make fools of those who make predictions If you can t see this reader poll please refresh your page
