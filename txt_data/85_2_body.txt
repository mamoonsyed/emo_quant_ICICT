Qualcomm Inc s earnings were marred Wednesday by its complex legal fight with Apple Inc but the communications chip designer has other issues as well The good news was that its third quarter showed that its underlying chip business fared better than investors had expected Qualcomm QCOM 1 43 said that revenue in its QCT Qualcomm CDMA Technologies business was up 5 to 4 0 billion In contrast its licensing business which is fighting with Apple AAPL 3 58 and another unnamed customer over royalty rates received no payments from Apple its contract manufacturers and the other unnamed licensee Its QTL Qualcomm Technology Licensing business fell 42 to 1 2 billion in the quarter Last quarter Qualcomm told analysts during its conference call that another unnamed company underpaid royalties for more than 150 million in sales during the December quarter It said it was trying to work out the dispute with the licensee but that dispute is also still ongoing Qualcomm s forecast for the fiscal fourth quarter excluded licensing revenue from Apple and its other unnamed customer disappointing analysts and its shares fell slightly in after hours trading So far this year Qualcomm s shares are down nearly 13 The descent began after Apple sued the company in January for 1 billion saying its communications chip licensing terms were too onerous The S P 500 SPX 0 81 in contrast is up about 10 5 year to date In addition to these sticky legal issues investors have to grapple with the fact that the company s 47 billion mega merger with NXP Inc is still undergoing regulatory reviews in five remaining geographies after clearing approval in the U S Taiwan and two other regions European antitrust regulators have asked for more information Company executives said on Wednesday s call that they were very optimistic about demonstrating the complementary nature of the deal to European regulators At the same time in late May Bloomberg News reported that activist and hedge fund investors including Elliott Management are pressuring NXP s management to renegotiate the deal with Qualcomm at a higher price which analysts asked about on the call We re confident we re going to go ahead and close this on the terms that we ve agreed to by year end said Cristiano Amon president of Qualcomm s CDMA Technologies business Company executives were also asked about whether they were considering breaking up the chip business from the licensing business a question that has dogged management in the past I think we ve looked at it pretty heavily in the past said Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf At this point I think we feel like we have the right structure to resolve this dispute as well as to position the business for the future in terms of the transition into 5G as well as the growth into driving the cellular roadmap Even so analysts are beginning to get nervous about Qualcomm possibly facing a higher price for NXP which is already the biggest semiconductor deal yet As Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research summed it up ahead of earnings Given the structural issues facing the company potential for downward revisions to the core business potential for higher outlay for NXP and the in our opinion low probability of a near term Apple settlement we stay on the sidelines For investors that seems like the best advice with all of Qualcomm s issues right now
