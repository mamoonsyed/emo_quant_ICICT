Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 69 Underlying sales increased 15 3 including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by the other two product lines across all regions For the second quarter the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy THVT sales of 487 5 million reflecting 16 5 growth over the prior year quarter In the U S THVT sales in the quarter were 316 3 million up 28 4 year over year Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance results being delivered by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were 207 1 million up 4 2 from the prior year quarter This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve Critical Care sales were 147 2 million in the reported quarter representing an increase of 3 7 from second quarter 2016 Solid growth across all product categories was driven by double digit growth in the company s Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program mainly in the U S and Asia Pacific Margins In the first quarter gross margin expanded 160 basis points bps to 74 9 owing to a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves This was however partially offset by adverse foreign exchange SG A expenses rose 6 6 year over year to 243 8 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses primarily in the Transcatheter Valve THV segment On the other hand R D expenditures increased 19 5 year over year to 134 4 million owing to continued investments in the company s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs including expenditure on clinical trials Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 160 bps to 29 9 as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses Edwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of 1 13 billion compared with 918 9 million at the end of the
