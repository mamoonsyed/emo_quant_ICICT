Tesla s NASDAQ TSLA 2016 Q4 earnings report offered little encouragement to Tesla investors on the financial front While Tesla s revenue came in close to expectations at 2 284 billion for a phenomenal 88 y y growth the company posted an operating loss of 266 7 million that was even larger than last year s loss of 260 3 million And investors have little hope of profitability in the first half of the year The first shock to investors systems was the announcement of CFO Jason Wheeler s departure Wheeler had only joined the company in November 2015 We ve been seeing a lot of executive churn at Tesla and it hardly seems a good thing Wheeler intends to pursue opportunities in public policy Something seems not quite right here Not to cast aspersions on Wheeler s stated intentions but somehow it seems that if things were going really well at Tesla he would see that as the best way to effect positive change Whereas the best public policy job I can see him getting would be at an environmentalist think tank for perhaps 1 10th of what he s making now Giving up Tesla to become a lobbyist even a lobbyist in a good cause Hmm Perhaps or perhaps after assembling Tesla s latest financial report he just had enough There s no way to candy coat this folks It s just plain ugly Scary ugly While Tesla s revenue was down by 1 sequentially from Q3 GAAP operating expenses ballooned by 27 sequentially to 702 million Worse yet this cost growth was not only due to the SolarCity acquisition Tesla only accounted SolarCity s contribution to the earnings report from the close of the acquisition on November 21 Tesla states that SolarCity contributed 85 million of the 151 million in operating cost growth So the worst is probably yet to come GAAP automotive gross margin also sank from 29 4 in Q3 to 22 6 It s as if all the progress that Tesla made or seemed to make last quarter simply evaporated At no point in the conference call did I hear a satisfactory explanation of why gross margin fell so much especially since the number of cars produced in Q4 was about the same as Q3 In Q3 Tesla produced 25 185 vehicles and in Q4 it produced 24 882 vehicles Presumably the problems with integrating the new Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA hardware and Tesla Vision software to support Enhanced Autopilot are the explanation for the lower gross margin Tesla had already claimed this as the reason for the failure to meet the Q4 delivery goal But Tesla didn t make it clear that there also was a cost hit involved with the transition Tesla did guide to a recovery of Q3 GAAP automotive gross margin in the first half of the year This suggests that the worst of the problems with Enhanced Autopilot are behind them but perhaps not all of them After all Tesla has yet to achieve parity with the previous Mobileye NYSE MBLY based Autopilot During the conference call Musk reiterated that parity would be achieved next month On top of the mysterious disappearing margin accounts payable appears to have grown dramatically In Q3 accounts payable and accrued liabilities also grew to 2 301 billion At the time I argued that this was below the pace of revenue growth and to be expected based on the expansion of vehicle production However there was no vehicle production expansion in Q4 yet the combined categories of accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaled 3 070 billion in Q4 So Tesla s bottom line could have been even worse if it had paid its bills a little more promptly And of course Tesla s long term debt also ballooned to over 7 billion from the 2 7 billion it had in Q3 as a result of SolarCity Tesla guided to 47 50 000 deliveries in the first half of the year which represents substantial y y growth of 61 71 Musk reiterated that Tesla was on track to begin production of the Model 3 by July and that production volume would reach 5 000 vehicles week by the end of the year and 10 000 week in 2018 Tesla claims that most of the operating expense increases are to support this growth and that it will spend 2 0 2 5 billion in capex in the first half of the year to support the Model 3 launch Gigafactory production ramp and expansion of service and charging infrastructure How does Tesla afford all this when it s bleeding cash Cash consumed in operating activities was 448 million in Q4 Can you say capital raise Elon can and he did during the conference call He couched it in terms of wanting to minimize risk One wonders for whom Based on Tesla s financial condition and what I heard in the conference call I think it s a foregone conclusion that there will be a capital raise So Tesla raises its capital probably about 3 billion and manages to fund the Model 3 production start up and all the other things it wants to do in the near term such as doubling the number of Superchargers in the US Does Tesla ever get across the finish line Does Tesla actually manage to get to a production rate of 500 000 cars all three models included per year One analyst during the conference call seriously probed Musk about this issue and I don t think he got a particularly satisfactory answer His question was simple how do you go from producing 2 000 cars week to producing 10 000 cars per week He wanted to know what could produce that amount of acceleration of the assembly line Musk hemmed and hawed well it s about the machine that builds the machines increased automation fewer people on the assembly line a simpler car we re smarter and more experienced now The fact is that no one will really know how fast Tesla can produce the Model 3 until it starts to produce them And that s the big risk with Tesla Not that Tesla is a sham company designed to bilk investors The Gigafactory isn t a Potemkin Village The Model 3 isn t just an empty fiberglass shell for display purposes Tesla is going to finish the current round of Gigafactory expansion Tesla is going to finish the Model 3 production line and start building Model 3s The big risk is that when all is said and done Tesla still won t be able to make a profit because it just can t build cars fast enough So I see Tesla as a well meaning but very risky venture Despite the recent appreciation of the stock I can t recommend it as a buy as much as I might like to Tesla has positive discriminators in its Enhanced Autopilot and high performance BEV technology but this is counterbalanced by financial and technical risk Generally I ve argued against second guessing Tesla on technical grounds but in the case of production rate on the Model 3 I think it s reasonable to question Tesla s expectations Tesla is breaking new ground in its machine that builds the machine approach of using very high levels of automation There s no way to know how quickly Tesla can ramp production on Model 3 It may be that given an infinite amount of time to perfect the machine that builds the machines Tesla could reach its 10 000 vehicles per week goal But Tesla doesn t have an infinite amount of time Tesla indicated that automotive gross margins would recover in H1 and that it was taking steps I had thought were necessary to minimize losses at SolarCity This involves basically eliminating the creative financing lease and PPA options for residential solar installations I believe it s reasonable to give Tesla until July to see how things play out in the SolarCity acquisition and Model 3 production start I continue to rate Tesla a hold although with somewhat elevated risk Note to readers Beginning March 1 I ll be starting a new Marketplace service At that point
