On Thursday morning shares of Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO hit a new 52 week high after the company s fiscal Q2 earnings report While the company did beat on the top and bottom line it wasn t a blowout by any means and the guidance was not spectacular With shares surging currently along with the market investors looking to buy probably want to wait for the next pullback Cisco beat on the top line but was well within its quarterly guidance The most significant number in my opinion was the non GAAP penny per share beat which was the smallest beat in nearly two years Margins were squeezed a little primarily due to product mix and non GAAP operating profit declined by 3 In a market where investors are looking for growth declining revenues and flat non GAAP earnings are not appealing As I discussed in my earnings preview article some investors were probably more interested in dividend news The quarterly payout has been raised by three cents to 0 29 a share per quarter or 1 16 annually As you can see in the chart below Cisco has grown its dividend quite nicely in recent years Shares currently yield about 3 50 on an annual basis For the April ending fiscal Q3 Cisco guided to revenues in a range of flat to down 2 along with non GAAP EPS of 0 57 to 0 59 Analysts were expecting a 1 2 decline and 0 58 so guidance is basically in line with estimates However when you take a look at the chart below shares have run considerably in the past year especially in recent weeks with the overall market at new highs While Cisco shares are up 3 on the earnings report I wouldn t be rushing to buy the stock currently The dividend raise was as expected but the overall earnings report didn t change the status quo Revenues are still declining and non GAAP EPS isn t really blowing out expectations With the stock already at yearly highs going into the report I m surprised we haven t gotten a pullback yet For investors waiting to buy wait till the stock comes back down because this earnings report wasn t the best we ve seen this earnings season Disclosure I we have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure Investors are always reminded that before making any investment you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article Investors should also consider seeking advice from a broker or financial adviser before making any investment decisions Any material in this article should be considered general information and not relied on as a formal investment recommendation
