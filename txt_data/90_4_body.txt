Amazon kingpin of the industry disruptors is rattling the grocery business like never before with its estimated 13 7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods The deal which woke up Wall Street on what was expected to be a sleepy Friday morning will not only ripple through the supermarket business but the entire economy Moreover anyone who thinks Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos ambition stops with the proposed Whole Foods buyout is whistling past the grocery aisle Look for Seattle based Amazon to eventually make a run at other expansion or buyout targets in the realms of pharmaceuticals health care industrial supplies or something we aren t smart enough to recognize yet Right now the business of groceries where a mere 3 percent of sales takes place online is Amazon s big play Before the Whole Foods announcement the online retailer was already relentlessly picking away at established supermarket companies including those that own local food chains Jewel Osco and Mariano s by marketing and selling more grocery products over its website Using the same formula Amazon has executed successfully since it began hawking books in 1994 the company ships straight to buyers and in the process also lowers transaction costs That discount makes consumers happy but drives traditional sellers which are paying for expensive overhead absolutely crazy But delivering food is a tricky proposition one that requires Amazon to rethink its fundamental product distribution scheme Unlike books hardware or electronics food deliveries must be extremely well timed In transit fish meat veggies and fruits have to stay fresh and frozen foods can t be allowed to thaw That s where a national food chain like Whole Foods comes in handy The acquisition of the 431 store company provides Amazon with a widespread community distribution network Those stores will make it easier for Amazon to effectively deliver its online grocery orders to nearby customers residences In the Chicago area Whole Foods has 26 grocery stores At the same time Amazon s on the go shoppers can stop by a Whole Foods and quickly pick up their online orders without having to spend time on a full blown grocery store trip Another benefit of this deal The online company s Amazon Prime and Whole Foods both cater to upscale buyers so chances are there s already significant customer overlap and brand recognition between them For traditional grocery store chains this deal is a very scary proposition Albertsons Kroger Roundy s and smaller regional chains will come under increased pressure to compete against the online might of Amazon Whole Foods For them it means scrambling to invest lots of cash in new technology teaming up or merging with giant superstore retailers that have growing online capabilities like Walmart or Costco or aligning themselves more closely with online grocery sellers such as locally based Peapod Instacart or perhaps Amazon Fresh Maybe Target which is the midst of a comeback effort will opt to exit the grocery business a simmering trouble spot for the Minneapolis based retailer Anyone who wonders how disruptive Amazon can be to an established industry only has to look at the collapsing world of old style mall based retail Primarily because of Amazon scores of well known chains and department stores are shuttering hundreds of their outlets or just totally closing shop We see it every day Illinois where Amazon plans to hire at least 8 000 people at nine distribution facilities will be playing a significant role in Bezos expansion dream wherever it takes him Right now he s focused on making the Whole Foods deal click But Amazon the massive industry disruptor is only getting started
