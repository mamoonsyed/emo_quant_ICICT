After the close on Wednesday Square NYSE SQ reported Q1 results that absolutely smashed analyst estimates The mobile payments provider continues to shake off doubters that CEO Jack Dorsey can handle dual CEO roles with Twitter NYSE TWTR The stock surged beyond 20 on the report and smashed my investment thesis along the way that Square was now overvalued The general question now is whether these results adjust the investment thesis In the course of the last year Square has gone from the market doubting the ability to leverage up growth to losing their biggest customer yet still improving margins dramatically The mobile payments provider went with a 0 05 adjusted loss last Q1 to a 0 05 profit last quarter Investors though need to make sure they use accurate numbers when evaluating the stock A lot of the financial sites are using the GAAP estimates for an 0 08 loss in which case Square only beat estimates by 0 04 due to reporting a 0 04 loss on a GAAP basis Using the adjusted numbers Square grew the EPS 0 10 over the prior year Q1 The adjusted net income improved by an incredible 30 million in one year Another key point is the share count Square is now reporting shares outstanding of 404 million even after buying out a 9 5 million share warrant from Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX for 55 million Remember that the listed share count was a big issue at the time of the IPO The company listed up to 106 million stock options and the 9 5 million warrants making the potential diluted share count possibly up to 440 million shares Now that Square is reporting a profit the diluted share count should accurately include the stock options in the money now Using this share count the market valuation is now roughly 8 2 billion At an adjusted revenue target of roughly 900 million the stock trades at about 9 1x that sales target Considering Square is only marginally profitable with a high end target EPS target for 2017 of 0 24 excluding the convertible debt costs making a stock value above 20 highly questionable Investors see the market value of PayPal NASDAQ PYPL now reaching close to 60 billion so chasing the stock becomes tempting The valuation comparison should make one pause on Square The key investor takeaway is that Square has exceeded even my highest expectations with the Q1 results The stock though has already far outrun the actual results I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure The information contained herein is for informational purposes only Nothing in this article should be taken as a solicitation to purchase or sell securities Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion or consult a financial advisor Investing includes risks including loss of principal
