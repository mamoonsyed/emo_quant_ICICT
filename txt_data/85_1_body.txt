Memory chipmaker Micron NASDAQ MU outperformed mobile chipmaker Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM by a mile over the past 12 months Micron rallied over 140 during that period while Qualcomm gained just 3 Last October I compared and concluded that Micron had more growth potential Unfortunately I didn t take my own advice and buy any Micron shares So today I ll take a fresh look at both stocks to see if Micron remains the better buy at current prices Micron is the fourth largest NAND manufacturer and the third largest DRAM manufacturer in the world Samsung NASDAQOTH SSNLF is the market leader in both categories To keep pace with its bigger rivals Micron is developing faster memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint with Intel and buying manufacturers like Inotera Memories It also develops enterprise SSDs solid state drives with Seagate which counters Western Digital s acquisition of flash memory maker SanDisk Qualcomm is the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world Its flagship Snapdragon SoCs system on chips bundle together application processors GPUs and baseband modems for mobile OEMs Qualcomm has been diversifying that business into adjacent markets like wearables drones cars and other Internet of Things IoT devices Qualcomm s chipmaking business generates most of its revenue but the lion s share of its profits comes from its higher margin licensing business which leverages its portfolio of wireless patents to earn a cut of each connected device sold worldwide A global shortage of memory chips which boosted market prices over the past year has been a major tailwind for Micron That s why Wall Street expects Micron s revenue to rise 62 this year and for its earnings to surge from 0 06 per share last year to 4 71 this year However investors should note that Micron s growth is cyclical As year over year comparisons cool off Micron s revenue and earnings are expected to respectively rise 12 and 28 next year Those are still solid numbers but investors should be mindful of two tougher competition from market leaders like Samsung and the possibility of Chinese chipmakers flooding the market with cheaper memory chips Meanwhile Qualcomm faces tough headwinds It chipmaking business is ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek as well as first party chips from big OEMs like Samsung and Huawei Its licensing business is besieged by regulators rivals and customers that Qualcomm s licensing practices are anti competitive That s why analysts expect Qualcomm s revenue and earnings to respectively fall 4 and 5 this year Its growth is expected to remain negative next year But there are glimmers of hope on the horizon it could diversify away from mobile chips and its planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NASDAQ NXPI would further diversify its business and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world Micron has never paid a dividend and it has no plans to do so in the near future That s because it s likely smarter for Micron to reinvest its cash into new memory products to widen its moat Qualcomm pays a forward yield of 4 and it s raised that payout annually for 12 straight years It spent 56 of its free cash flow on that dividend over the past 12 months so it has plenty of room for future hikes But even after its massive rally Micron looks surprisingly cheap at 14 times earnings compared to the industry average P E of 15 for memory chipmakers Its forward P E of 5 looks even cheaper Qualcomm trades at 19 times earnings which is lower than the industry average of 25 for semiconductor makers Its forward P E of 12 which doesn t account for the NXP acquisition also looks fairly cheap Micron is firing on all cylinders its stock is cheap and industry tailwinds should propel it to new highs The only real risk to Micron is an abrupt decline in demand for memory chips but that seems unlikely with the PC market finally Qualcomm remains stuck between a rock and a hard place I don t see the stock declining much more thanks to its high dividend and low valuation but its future depends heavily on its ability to close the NXP deal So for now Micron still has much more upside potential than Qualcomm at current prices
