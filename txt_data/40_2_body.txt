Advanced Micro Devices Inc has been on a major stock tear in the last year on the hopes and dreams for a new family of chips for PCs gaming consoles and servers The first returns on AMD s AMD 1 37 efforts did not live up to those hopes and dreams however The chip maker s first quarter earnings and its outlook for the current quarter were mostly in line with analysts expectations but apparently did not come close to what speculators hoped AMD shares plunged 10 in after hours trading wiping away the frothy gains collected since its last earnings report AMD s stock was up about 20 this year easily outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA 0 14 and the S P 500 index SPX 0 81 Investors betting on a big swing from AMD were hoping for a big revenue and margin upswing as AMD re enters the corporate server market where it has barely had a presence in the last few years and the high end PC arena AMD launched its PC chips last quarter and plans to launch server chips this quarter but the forecast it provided did not signal that early returns will have a huge impact as many expected Given Q2 contains a full quarter s worth of Ryzen as well as the Naples and Vega launches the company needs to guide materially above expectations Stacy Rasgon a Bernstein Research analyst wrote in a note last week There was a lot of consternation on the company s conference call with analysts about the forecast for slightly lower gross profit margins of 33 in the second quarter versus 34 in the first quarter which the company said is mostly due to more gaming consoles in the product mix and higher manufacturing costs It will take us a couple of quarters to transition the overall portfolio to Ryzen Chief Executive Lisa Su said on the call when asked what percentage of the quarter s revenue was based on Ryzen sales Ryzen which was launched in early March was the first product based on AMD s new Zen architecture AMD executives said they were very pleased with how the launches of the new products were going and that Naples the company s chip for servers remains on track for launch this quarter Related Five doomed stocks to sell in May I think second quarter will be higher than first quarter but I would expect second half to be higher Su said when asked if Ryzen would contribute more in the second quarter As you know the PC business tends to be very back half loaded Su added that the back to school and holiday quarters would be very important and would benefit from the company s stronger portfolio of products She also said AMD is still looking for gross profit margins ranging from 36 to 40 for the longer term and that AMD had multiple ways of getting there but that 2017 would be dominated by lower margin PC sales In 2017 a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs Su said I think as you go into 2018 you ll see a larger percentage of that be in servers Patrick Moorhead principal analyst with Moor Insights Strategies said he was pleased with the Ryzen launch so far noting that computing products revenue was up 30 year over year I was actually happy given that Ryzen is only one month in he said adding that he was looking for a bigger impact from the new products in the second half of the year In the second half you have everything hitting he said striking the same notes as Su on Ryzen based PCs and gaming consoles receiving back to school and holiday boosts plus the Vega graphics chip However Moorhead doesn t believe the Naples server chip will show any meaningful financial performance until 2018 That is the issue for investors who have gotten into AMD based on the potential for its new products as they must now debate whether to continue to hold and hope for a really big second half or even a 2018 payoff Given AMD s inconsistent execution history and the number of short sellers in the stock it s no wonder that many have decided not to stick around to see the end of the story
