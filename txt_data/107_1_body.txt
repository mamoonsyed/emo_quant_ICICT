YouTube has over 1 5 billion monthly viewers amid a hot market for video advertising and is likely Alphabet Inc s second biggest business after Google s core internet search business But in Alphabet s second quarter results on Monday the overall Google business still did not include a break out of YouTube s financial performance to the detriment of investors Alphabet GOOGL 4 26 GOOG 4 80 bundles YouTube results in its overall Google properties advertising revenue which soared nearly 20 from a year ago to 18 4 billion Google says in regulatory filings that its Google properties revenue consists primarily of advertising sales generated on Google s website and app YouTube and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail Google Maps and Google Play YouTube is clearly the star right now beyond search however based on the attention executives gave to the video site in Monday s earnings call YouTube was mentioned 25 times according to a rough transcript of the call challenging the word search 32 times and dominating Google Play and Gmail three times apiece as well as Maps seven times The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai who joined Alphabet s board Monday also focused on the video site discussing the 1 5 billion users and saying that they watched on average an hour a day of YouTube on phones and tablets But that shows one of the problems in disclosing these types of metrics in conference calls with general terminology Was that just mobile viewing We may never know since Google does not disclose these metrics in terms that it defines somewhere for investors to find In addition new revenue recognition rules that Alphabet has already adopted suggest that Alphabet should be disclosing YouTube results The rules call for companies to disclose results as they are being reported to the chief decision maker and Porat s statements about growth suggest that there are certainly YouTube results floating around the company s C suite Alphabet s lack of hard data behind its offerings is annoying but it could also be detrimental to its stock Investors may have found a reason to bid Google s stock price higher with hard data showing YouTube s growth Monday but instead they seemed to focus on the falling cost per clicks or CPC metric and increasing traffic acquisition costs or TAC Google s CPC fell 23 in the quarter compared with a drop of 7 in the same period a year ago while TAC increased to 22 of advertising revenue from 21 a year ago a combination that could be worrisome for Alphabet Beyond standard revenue and earnings both of which beat expectations handily in Monday s report and some limited segmentation that alphabet soup of acronyms are about the only metrics of consequence that Alphabet shares with the public They seemed to have an effect Monday Despite the earnings beat Alphabet stock fell about 3 in after hours trading after gaining 13 6 in the previous three months to outperform the S P 500 index SPX 0 81 which added 4 in that time This is a company though that loves to be vague Ever since it went public Google Alphabet has not given investors any kind of financial guidance or helpful outlook because the company s founders Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Sergey Brin do not want investors to have a mentality focused on quarterly results So investors without much else additional info beyond a breakout of Alphabet s money losing Other Bets segment will continue to focus on an opaque bucket of revenue and wonky advertising metrics that would make most eyes glaze over If Alphabet wants to celebrate its growing businesses such as YouTube and Google Cloud as much as executives did in Monday s conference call it needs to provide some real numbers in a standardized manner It might be pleasantly surprised by the results
