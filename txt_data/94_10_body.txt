IBM s NYSE IBM different segments and especially the cloud segment have been growing rapidly So much so that some have even tried to argue that IBM might actually be turning into a growth company It is undeniable that some of the segments are experiencing impressive growth rates but these segments are so small that they are barely making a dent in the overall revenue In this analysis I ll lay out the different segment and their growth rates and show why although the future is bright IBM is by no means a growth company and should not be treated as such This is not to say that IBM is a bad company or stock per say but I am saying that investors looking to buy IBM should do so primarily for the dividend and not for growth Revenue from the cognitive solutions segment was 5 3 billion in 4Q16 which showed growth of 2 The increase in segment revenue was caused by a 53 increase by cloud solutions However the cloud solutions made up for only 11 of the total segment revenue Watson is an important part of the cognitive solutions segment The company designed Watson on the IBM cloud so that clients have more insights and control of their data Previously client data was used primarily to educate a central knowledge graph The new tools will attract customers as they are able to extract more value from the same data In the future Watson should be equipped with vertical solutions and trained on specific industry domains The upside here is that it allows IBM to get an edge both in terms of quality industry specific domains and it increases IBM s ability to up sell some of its products Global business services showed revenue of 4 1 billion in 4Q16 which translates to growth of 4 Cloud grew by 77 to 0 9 billion and thus represents the biggest growth rate as part of the segment It seems that management is seeing an opportunity here and is looking to invest more aggressively As I ve alluded to in my introduction these are impressive growth rates Especially the 70 growth of the cloud practice However this segment was only worth 0 9 billion in 4Q16 or 4 13 of IBM s total 4Q16 revenue This segment would need multiple factors of growth in order to make a dent on the bottom line Still one can wonder how aggressive this shift is when cloud represents a very small fraction of total revenues Revenue grew by 2 to 9 3 billion in 4Q16 The revenue is generated by strategic imperatives and cloud services Strategic imperatives make up 2 6 billion 37 growth Cloud makes up 1 8 billion 50 growth compared to last year For this segment management plans to increase its cloud services according to the transcript This is by far the company s biggest segment and represents roughly 43 of 4Q16 s total revenue The growth here however is almost non existent Notice how management touts the 50 growth in cloud and 37 growth in strategic imperatives but combined these generate a mere 4 4 billion for this segment In other words there is a big part of this segment 52 7 that is declining because the overall growth rate of the Technology Services and Cloud Platform segment is actually close to zero 2 By creating a weighted average the revenue contributors and dividing them by their respective weighing we can work out that the rest of the 3 9 billion in revenue actually declined by around 36 Revenue was 2 5 billion in 4Q16 12 growth compared to last year The revenue exists of strategic imperatives and cloud services Strategic imperatives makes up 1 1 billion an 18 growth Cloud services makes up 0 9 billion growth of 15 The systems segment also is ready for an era of cloud computing according to the transcript No doubt management will see lots of growth in the cloud part of this segment as well but you know the drill by now The amount of revenue that cloud contributes is actually fairly insignificant as of yet Lots of future growth or not really The four segments generated a total of 77 9 billion in 2016 If we take the same growth percentages for each segment for 2017 the total revenue for the four segments would be 80 76 billion in 2017 By using the same net profit margin of 2016 which was 14 86 the forecasted net income would be 12 billion Since net income in 2016 was 11 872 billion this means that the net income for 2017 only has a growth potential of 1 With an expected net income for 2017 of 12 billion and 944 91 million outstanding shares this leads to an earnings per share of 12 70 Comparing this amount with the earnings per share of 2016 namely 12 36 this leads to a 2 75 increase in earnings per share for 2017 IBM s stock price is currently 171 09 and has a PE of 13 8 While I don t think IBM is overvalued I find it hard to justify a higher multiple based on their growth potential The stock is well priced and has little growth potential even if the four segments can keep up the growth rates of 2016 While IBM is by no means a growth stock it is still a fairly solid blue chip that pays a 3 3 dividend Investors looking to buy IBM for growth will be hard pressed to find any Those who are looking to buy IBM because they are looking for a decent dividend yield from a blue chip stock will do well here
