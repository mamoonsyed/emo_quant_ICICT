Back at the end of November last year I wrote an article suggesting that those bullish on the prospects for Cyber Monday should consider playing their belief in a way less obvious than simply buying stock in Amazon AMZN The argument then was that the expectations for and indeed the valuation of Amazon were such that even a decent holiday period for the online retailer could provoke only a so so reaction whereas any hint of weakness could see the stock punished My suggestion then was that investors should consider the major credit card companies MasterCard MA and Visa V instead Now that Q4 earnings for all of the companies concerned are out that seems to have played out pretty well and the case for V and MA remains strong To recap the card companies earnings MasterCard who released on Monday reported numbers that were essentially in line with a small beat of EPS and a small miss in revenue terms but highlighted by sales growth of nearly ten percent on an annual basis Visa reported last night and beat on both the top and bottom lines while also reporting noticeable growth Some are quoting the fact that transactions processed by Visa increased by 39 over last year but that is not a direct comparison as the latest number includes transactions from Visa Europe while last year s did not A more reliable indicator of growth is U S transactions which increased by a not too shabby 12 What makes both V and MA such good long term plays for investors though is the big picture circumstances that seem to be inexorably moving in their favor Online shopping continues to increase exponentially not just here in the U S but around the world and despite the best efforts of PayPal PYPL and others credit and debit cards remain the go to payment method for online shoppers Visa and MasterCard combined account for over 85 of global payment volume in general so even if online shopping growth stalls for some unforeseeable reason both companies look set to continue growing At some point it is possible that Bitcoin or some other virtual currency will gain ground and do damage to that dominance but at the moment that looks far enough away to not present a realistic problem to investors As I pointed out in the above referenced article one of the strongest features of the earnings for both Visa and MasterCard is that they have spectacular margins nudging 40 in both cases The wider implementation of new technology such as microchip based transactions will possibly hold those margins back for a while but in the long run will increase profitability by reducing the incidence of fraud Of course if the entire global economy slows then card payments will suffer along with everything else but the cyclical nature of economics can t be avoided The simple fact is that as these recent earnings releases have demonstrated as long as people continue to buy things and especially as those purchases continue to shift towards e commerce both Visa and MasterCard will continue to grow On that basis they are stocks that should be a part of everyone s long term portfolio
