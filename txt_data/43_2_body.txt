Last year Tesla quietly hired one of the world s best chip designers Jim Keller He helped Apple create its own mobile processors as well as led the development of a number of important AMD chips Under Elon Musk Tesla has been obsessed with making every itself so it seems likely custom chips are on their way It appears Keller s former chip employer AMD may be helping Tesla out Tesla is currently building a custom chip for autonomous driving using AMD intellectual property according to a report at CNBC citing a source The chip will likely focus on accelerating artificial intelligence algorithms such as deep learning necessary for cars to drive themselves The report said more than 50 people are working on the chip under Keller Other high up AMD chip engineers joined Keller at Tesla including Ganesh Venkataramanan Bill McGee and Dan Bailey The CNBC report also said AMD spin off GlobalFoundries CEO Sanjay Jha announced that the chip fab is working with Tesla at its tech conference on Wednesday A GlobalFoundries spokesperson said the CEO was misreported GlobalFoundries does not comment on customers or potential customers Sanjay simply cited that companies like Apple Google and Tesla are examples of the types of businesses showing interest in working closely with silicon companies to differentiate their offerings the spokesperson said in a written statement Tesla has not committed to working with us on any autonomous driving technology or product Any partnership between Tesla and AMD would be a big loss for graphics processor company Nvidia and its autonomous car ambitions Nvidia has had an early lead in the AI market over its fellow chipmakers and had won a spot in Tesla s Autopilot 2 0 announcement last year When announcing the next generation Autopilot Musk called the decision a tight call going with Nvidia over AMD Musk has said that fully autonomous driving will be available to Tesla drivers by 2019 Before Nvidia Tesla had been using Mobileye for advanced driver assist Mobileye would end up being acquired by Intel for 15 billion earlier this year Intel has suddenly become a big player in the autonomous driving market Earlier this week Google s Waymo publicly disclosed that it has been using Intel hardware in its autonomous vehicle fleet Powering Waymo s autonomous Pacificas are Xeon processors Arria FPGA chips for image analytics and Gigabit Ethernet and XM modems for connectivity and communications Some Wall Street analysts reacted with skepticism over how much AMD could be working with Tesla Comprehensive view is that Tesla and Nvidia have currently a 5 year contract in place which was renewed just recently wrote Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities Research in note as quoted by Barron s AMD is not a Player AMD is DoD Dead on Departure in DML Deep Machine Learning Workloads Nevertheless the idea that Tesla is working on their own AI processor for autonomous driving is clear to some analysts regardless if that involves AMD or not The idea of Tesla eventually doing their own self driving chipsets should not be a surprise to anyone as the writing has clearly been on the wall for some time and if it isn t happening now it likely will at some point wrote Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research in a note Custom chips designed to handle the advanced image recognition and artificial intelligence software is quickly becoming a hot market A popular type of AI called deep learning is being applied in areas like image and speech recognition Nvidia s graphics processors or GPUs have become popular here for their parallel processing capabilities But even more specialized chips will likely be needed for greater power and efficiency These specialized AI chips have already begun showing up in the data center and phones Google has built two versions of a chip called the Tensor Processing Unit designed to accelerate its deep learning algorithms across its sprawling data centers And Apple s latest phone contain the A11 Bionic chip that includes a dedicated processor for accelerating deep learning for applications like facial recognition It s no surprise that these AI chips are now coming to the car With assistance from Alan Ohnsman in Los Angeles
