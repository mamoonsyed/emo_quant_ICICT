Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent and tech giant International Business Machines Corp NYSE IBM reports earnings Tuesday night Right now I want to take you through a look at recent announcements charts and what if anything the options market is suggesting will happen to IBM stock after its first quarter report Analysts are forecasting earnings of 2 35 per share for IBM s first quarter implying no movement year over year after trending higher sequentially over the last three quarters That also would be a significant 53 drop from Q4 earnings of 5 01 per share Similarly IBM s revenues are expected to dip from last quarter s sales take of 21 8 billion to 18 4 billion The year over year sales decline is less severe just narrowly under Q1 2016 s result of 18 7 billion Still that would be the 20th consecutive annual decline Erosion in its mature IT data and service provider businesses are countering growth within the company s Strategic Imperatives SI unit and IBM s Watson product The Wall Street community is mixed to moderately bearish on IBM stock Among 27 polled analysts two thirds have hold recommendations compared to six buys and four sells The median price target on IBM stock is 168 which is less than current prices right above 170 Having said that if a bullish earnings surprise were to play out there s certainly room for upward and supportive revisions from analysts IBM has at least beat Street profit views in 10 of its past 12 quarters However investor reaction to quarterly results has proven awfully bearish in the aftermath Working backwards shares of IBM have moved 2 25 2 62 0 17 5 59 4 88 and 5 75 on a close to close basis The net reaction in IBM stock has produced an average loss of 2 79 with variability of 3 26 based on a one standard deviation reading When you combine the two metrics you see that IBM has favored the bears with an estimated range of 6 05 to a modest gain of 0 47 IBM s seven day stock performance has been less volatile and a bit more mixed in yielding an average loss of 0 72 with variability of 4 38 and a tied at the hip estimated range of 4 38 to 3 66 Click to Enlarge From multi year lows set last February IBM stock finished 2016 with solid gains approaching 18 The good news got even better for investors as the rally also established a new uptrend following a breakout of a three year downtrend line Thus far in 2017 IBM has continued with its bullish trend albeit at a slightly more subdued pace of 3 6 year to date that s mostly on par with the broader market s performance Currently and for the past couple months shares of IBM have pulled back into a constructive looking pullback pattern My interpretation is with weekly stochastics oversold and IBM having tested the 38 retracement level from its October pivot low there s evidence a critical low within the uptrend is being formed Yet if shares do continue to decline I d estimate IBM stock could fall to the prior breakout area near 162 while still maintaining the integrity of the uptrend
