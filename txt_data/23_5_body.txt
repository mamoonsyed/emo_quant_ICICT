Netflix announced the release of a new series titled Dear White People that s scheduled to launch on April 28 2017 As you could imagine the internet is on fire So what s going on here Let s address this point by point Netflix is telling us that all white people are out of touch with reality and need to be schooled All of them There aren t any qualifiers here Every white person from Bernie Sanders and Ann Coulter to Donald Trump and Diane Feinstein is out of touch when it comes to black people And of course let s not forget one of the show s creators who tweeted this caution foul language Really How is THAT okay Could you imagine someone saying that about African Americans Mexicans Arabs or fill in any other race here Heads would roll left and right and the Left would literally be setting cities on fire So yeah it s safe to say that Netflix may have a problem with people of certain skin pigmentations the very thing the Left has been up in arms over forever Progressives give Netflix a pass here because to the Left it s laudable to hate people with certain skin colors On a side note I wonder where Shaun King a prominent Black Lives Matter activist fits in here He s a white guy who has convinced himself that he s black Does he need to be schooled here too or does he get a pass because he also hates whites How does Netflix deal with guys like him First of all who DOES this What white people today dress up in blackface It s not common place cue the comments here where liberals show the few people who have actually done it What s more is that it s generally considered unacceptable in polite society Secondly why does the character in the trailer think she has the moral authority to tell a group of people what they can and cannot dress up as Isn t the Left pro choice Pro freedom of expression Have they given up on the whole tolerance thing Seems like it Being that Barack Obama our 44th President is half white why can t white people dress up like him or can they only half dress up like him The patronizing unapologetic racism coming from Netflix here is the stuff fantasy is made of Why is it inherently racist to want to dress up as an American president The Left loves this These people are the ones who ve been attending rallies over the past year calling people Nazi s and shrieking No Trump no KKK no fascist USA Shouldn t they at least play by their own rules Then in the trailer you see black people waltzing into a white party to physically attack them and destroy their property Super helpful Instead of judging people by the content of their character liberals have mainstreamed judging people by the color of their skin Is THIS show how we ll bring unity and reconcile people Here s the thing as a private company Netflix has the right to do just about whatever they d like They have every right to race bait divide and promote violent bigotry all in the name of entertainment and logical thinking people of every race tribe tongue and nation have the right to call them out on it All I m calling for is consistency At least play by your own rules At least pretend to try Because currently this show is drenched in duplicity It s like saying here s a game with no rules and then immediately saying right afterward Rule 1 is If you re against racism and bigotry as you should be then look in the mirror and hold yourself to the same standard We don t need a safe space or a trigger warning either That s not what this is about I won t be canceling my Netflix account well probably not We ve come to expect this from the Left They ve become everything they claim to hate They ve normalized racism and intolerance and made violent dissent and prejudice part of their platform Dialogue was thrown out the window years ago and replaced by Nazi accusations and safety pins The Left lost all over the globe in 2016 and will continue to lose because they have nothing to offer but destruction decay and Beyonce Socrates Plato Aristotle Augustine Kant Nietzsche Rousseau they all brought ideas Wrong or right they showed up to the party with something everyone could at least chew on But the Regressive Left They re like uninvited dinner guests who show up to the meal with a bag of frozen broccoli and have the audacity to wonder why nobody wants them at the table Ad hominems intolerance racism and bigotry don t win hearts and minds So keep calling names and causing division It s only causing more people in the middle to move to the right And while you re doing that we ll keep winning Brian L is a paleoconservative writer and startup marketing consultant who has a B A in Political Science an M A in Philosophy of Religion and a penchant for debunking humanity Find him on Twitter
