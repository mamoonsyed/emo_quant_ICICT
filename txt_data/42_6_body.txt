Shares of semiconductor chip supplier Advanced Micro Devices took a robust upturn today after the company s Q2 earnings call yesterday AMD reported a non GAAP earnings loss of two cents per share on revenue of 1 22 billion up 19 YOY from 1 03B last year in Q2 The company still isn t profitable however reporting a net loss of 16 million AMD did beat street estimates of 1 15 billion in revenue despite just missing break even Regardless AMD achieved significant positive movement in both revenue growth and balance sheet health fueled by its core bread and butter CPU and GPU business units Specifically revenue from Computing and Graphics grew 59 percent year on year to 659 million on sales of both AMD s new Ryzen desktop processor family and its Radeon graphics cards which have been selling like hotcakes in the recent run up in crypto currency mining and block chain technologies like Ethereum AMD CEO Dr Lisa Su was less committal on continued growth from cryptocurrency business a hint to its recent wild volatility but shared encouraging words in general on the company s CPU and GPU business With Ryzen CPUs now contributing to revenue a new high end enthusiast many core processor called Threadripper about to hit Radeon RX Vega gaming GPUs expected in the market very soon and its new EPYC server processor platform now just shipping to OEM partners the company appears to be on a strong trajectory for continued growth What s interesting about the cryptocurrency GPU revenue spike is that it came at just the right time as Ryzen revenues began to ramp and while EPYC server processor revenues are quite possibly just waiting in the wings The battle in the server market for AMD versus Intel is just getting warmed up but the company is at least firmly on the map now where in more recent times they didn t have a footprint Su was bullish of course on the company s prospects with EPYC versus Intel s new Xeon Scalable series of server chips noting its high degree of flexibility in configuration with better performance per dollar metrics Su noted We are selling a portfolio of products that scale from 500 to over 4 000 At each price point we offer more performance per dollar and more I O per dollar This is true from an architectural standpoint in a number of ways where core counts per socket 32 cores versus Intel s max 28 and available PCI Express lanes per CPU root complex for connectivity are still significantly more robust than even Intel s latest Xeon family However though AMD has already announced key server design wins only time will tell how EPYC is received in the data center market and how much of an impact it will make on AMD s bottom line Regardless the upside potential for AMD with EPYC is huge and the portfolio is squarely targeting Intel s cash cow business If AMD is able to make any sort of significant impact at all with EPYC their next earnings call could be even more impressive To that end the AMD CEO offered a bold prediction of 23 percent sequential revenue growth for Q3 along with a very interesting tidbit when questioned on the status of the company s semi custom gaming console chip business which was soft for the quarter down 5 Su teased that there will be AMD silicon in the new Microsoft Xbox One X that ships this November but that also there was one additional design that will ramp in the second half of 2018 Since this was all in the same breath as AMD s Xbox and PlayStation business one can t help but speculate where this additional design win might come from Could it perhaps be the recently unveiled new Ataribox Atari s CEO Fred Chesnais has gone on record previously stating the new console will in fact be PC based Though Lisa Su was tight lipped on the project the timing of a Q4 to Q1 launch and a second half 2018 ramp for a new console certainly lines up well enough I ll stop there with the tea leaf reading and rumoring and just say that the outlook in general for AMD is looking better every day from the client desktop and workstation to data center servers and semi custom embedded And this appears to be just the beginning of the turn around Disclosure I currently hold no positions in AMD or INTC but have previously held small positions in both
