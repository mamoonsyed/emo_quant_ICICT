Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD stock appeared to be headed for a very bad day on Tuesday after the firm got an important downgrade from Barclays At time of writing shares had fallen by more than 3 percent in low volume pre market action Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said that shares were worth about 9 each if his model is correct On Monday s market AMD stock closed at a price of well over 13 Mr Curtis reckons that the AMD product line up just can t compete with that of other chipmakers The hype around AMD is driving stock out of his comfort zone Mr Curtis also changed his rating on AMD shares to Underweight from Equal Weight The analyst specifically points to two releases from Intel Corporation NASDAQ INTC and AMD Purley and Epyc respectively These are CPUs designed for very intense workloads way beyond the needs of an ordinary PC user After seeing the benchmarks for those products Curtis sees AMD chips as being competitive with their Intel counterparts There is however not much upside from here given the firm s progress He s predicting EPS of 8 cents per share for Fiscal Year 2017 He s projecting that to grow to 33 cents per share in FY18 but that does not justify the price multiple That s the problem for those holding Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD stock So much of the value of the firm is based on it recouping large market share from Intel Corporation NASDAQ INTC If Intel comes out with a better or cheaper product then it s possible that the boom in the value of Advanced Micro Devices Inc will end quickly At time of writing shares in Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD were down 3 4 percent in pre market trading The push behind that price change though appears to have been the Barclays report As the day wears on we ll find out whether or not the firm s value is built on solid ground If traders get worried about the hype things could get a lot worse before they get better First among the problems faced by those holding Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD is where the correct value lies That s because the firm s stock price has risen by more than 160 percent in the last twelve months Wall Street analysts are pretty divided on which direction shares are headed Price targets range from 4 to 20 while about double the firms 10 rate the firm Buy as rate it Sell The real consensus on Wall Street seems to be clear however If you re sensitive to risk don t go betting on AMD stock The above chart which shows Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD market share shows why some want to believe the hype For the first time in years AMD is really competing with Intel Combine that with a crypto currency based uptick in demand for graphics cards and AMD stock may begin to look like a good bet Because of the hype and the uncertainty now is not likely the time to bet the house on AMD It s a 13 billion firm that doesn t show a real profit Concluding from that investors should have enough of a clue to stay away BMO Capital also weighed in on the outlook for Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD on Tuesday The firm downgraded the stock from Hold to Sell The big worry for BMO is the sustainability of GPU sales on cryptocurrency worries Bottom line we are not at all bullish on the sudden surge on demand for GPU cards from cryptocurrency mining We see a fair bit of similarities to what happened in 2013 2014 which was a more than a one quarter bust for AMD after the boom in cryptocurrency mining the report which was picked up by The Street read At time of writing AMD stock was trading down by almost 4 percent as Wall Street worries about the boom bust cycle
