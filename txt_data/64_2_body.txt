Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE plunged as much as 7 Thursday falling to low of 23 in the after hour session after the tech giant reported mixed first quarter fiscal 2017 result after Thursday s closing bell that showed despite the improvements HPE has made to grow in the realm of the cloud competition from the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT aren t going away The Palo Alto Calif based tech giant stunned the market with more than 80 stock gains over the past year driven by its hybrid cloud initiatives While the company s transformation as a standalone entity since its separation from its printing arm Hewlett Inc HPQ has enabled HPE to show better financial performance HPE on Thursday needed to account for the level of confidence investors have shown In that regard the miss on revenue and tepid guidance wasn t enough In the three months that ended January Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported a net income of 267 million or 16 cents per share On an adjusted basis when taking out one time gains and costs earnings were 45 cents per share which beat Thomson Reuters forecast by a penny and above last year s total of 41 cents per share First quarter revenue of 11 41 billion meanwhile not only fell short of Street forecasts of 12 13 billion it marked a year over year decline of 10 4 Notably this is the company s third consecutive quarter during which it has missed on the top line The company s focus on hardware for data centers instead of faster growing software has posed a challenge The market for the latter particularly cloud services is forecast to increase more than 20 annually I believe HPE remains on the right track said Meg Whitman President and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in a statement The steps we re taking to strengthen our portfolio streamline our organization and build the right leadership team are setting us up to win long into the future Despite Whitman s confidence the company which has placed long term bets with investments in emerging markets reduced its fiscal 2017 earnings per share forecast to 1 88 to 1 98 compared to analysts estimates of 2 03 Among other reasons for lowering forecast Whitman cited currency fluctuations higher commodities prices on items such as memory chips for servers and near term execution issues These issues aside the stock s punishment Thursday seems like an overreaction though not surprising given the strong gains over the past year While I wouldn t recommend jumping in to buy HPE stock at the moment these shares currently around 23 should be bought if they fall to 22
