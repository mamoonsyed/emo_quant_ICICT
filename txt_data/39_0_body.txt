First let me try to clear up some of the confusion I ve seen in comments about what I have or have not said about Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Ryzen I ve seen claims that I said that Ryzen wouldn t be competitive Actually since the reveal of Ryzen last August I ve been fairly circumspect about not making sweeping generalizations about Zen now Ryzen performance Then I wrote In November I frankly acknowledged that Ryzen constituted a challenge to Intel NASDAQ INTC in Can Intel Counter The Zen Threat Then I wrote It s for that kind of extensive testing that I have been waiting before jumping to conclusions about Ryzen My reason for wanting to wait until the reviews came in was that I was always a little suspicious of the way in which AMD dribbled out performance data concerning Ryzen The benchmark data that was released was always very selective such as the Handbrake demo at CES Finally reviews have been published of the first Ryzen chips to be released the 1800X 1700X and 1700 I haven t surveyed all the reviews but have sampled a swath of reviews from what I consider to be reliable sources Ars Technica Tom s Hardware PC Gamer and AnandTech The reviews certainly confirm that AMD has delivered on the basic promise it made in 2015 regarding Zen However that was a long time ago and processor technology keeps moving forward Yes Ryzen has equaled or exceeded the performance of Intel s Broadwell E in many tests but ironically Ryzen falls well short of what is probably the most important Intel competition the 349 Core i7 7700 Kaby Lake After reading the reviews I realized that the really misleading part of AMD s marketing of Ryzen wasn t merely the selective benchmark comparisons with Broadwell E It was the focus of attention exclusively on Broadwell E Broadwell E was a straw man For most home computing applications especially gaming the i7 7700 turns out to be the better choice Tom s Hardware concluded The observation about gaming performance has been broadly confirmed in the other reviews I cited Of course AMD is never without a plethora of excuses The games tested weren t optimized for Ryzen disabling Symmetric Multi Threading SMT will improve gaming performance etc I m sure there s some truth in these But it wasn t just in gaming that Ryzen fell short of Kaby Lake The 95 W TDP rating of the 1800X turned out to be gratuitously inaccurate As Tom s testing showed that under high workloads the 1800 zoomed well past it The selective benchmarks AMD had shown implied to many that Ryzen had somehow achieved a miracle of power efficiency but no AMD s rating of the processor should have been more like 140 W Across a broad array of tasks such as Web browsing and Office tasks Ryzen also fell well short of Kaby Lake Where Ryzen really shone was in highly threaded applications where its multiple cores could be put to best use Mostly these were professional apps for performing specialized computation as seen below This has given rise to the impression that Ryzen having been derived from AMD s Zen server CPUs was really optimized for professional rather than home or even home enthusiast use In the eyes of AMD fans Ryzen s shortcoming will be viewed as minor and correctable Ryzen will undoubtedly sell and gain AMD some market share But AMD has clearly missed the home enthusiast sweet spot of 4 core 8 thread designs like Kaby Lake Ryzen is a very large chip being priced like a much smaller chip The likely consequence of this is that once again AMD will grow market share and revenue only to fail to be profitable At least that appears to be the current consensus among analysts polled by Yahoo Finance Revenue for the March quarter is projected to grow 18 y y but EPS is projected to be loss of 0 04 Probably based on the review data the projected revenue increase is overly optimistic The review data also indicates that Ryzen s longer term prospects are seriously in doubt Broadwell is the oldest architecture of Intel s 14 nm generation going on three years old In achieving comparable performance to Broadwell AMD has only skated to where the puck has been and gone Intel is already moving its Xeon line to Skylake Broadwell which has been the mainstay of Intel s Xeon as well as Broadwell E consumer chips is being retired Soon Intel will release a Skylake replacement for Broadwell E erasing whatever performance advantage Ryzen might have achieved And next year Intel s 10 nm consumer chips will become available raising the bar yet again in the 4 core sweet spot of the consumer market On the strength of AMD s likely gains in processor market share investors can expect AMD stock to continue to rise despite today s 7 drop Snap s NYSE SNAP IPO yesterday netted 3 4 billion at 17 share and today as of this writing participants in the IPO are doing very well indeed with the stock up to 24 83 It s probably indicative of how desperate the market is for a tech IPO that none of Snap s publicly traded shares have any voting rights whatsoever According to Time Snap s founders will even retain control of the company for nine months after they die How does one do that Will Snap s deceased founders be resurrected for board meetings Not that they should be expected to pass away any time soon Snap s CEO Evan Spiegel in only 26 The LA Times interviewed Spiegel briefly who explained the philosophy of Snapchat Snap apparently will remain focused on reinventing the camera and its founders will remain firmly in control GM Looks to an Unlimited Data Future General Motors NYSE GM has announced that Chevrolet owners with OnStar 4G LTE Wi Fi hotspots will be able to buy an unlimited data plan for 20 month OnStar uses AT T NYSE T for LTE access In 2016 GM customers used nearly 200 more data through OnStar than in 2015 What I find interesting about the plan is how it anticipates future connected cars specifically autonomous vehicles Such cars really will need unlimited data probably for both download and upload It has been estimated that connected cars will upload 25 GB of data every hour I m inclined to think that the load will not typically be that high even for autonomous vehicles Such vehicles may save data for later uploading via home Internet connections rather that attempt to upload over cellular networks But it s clear that autonomous vehicles could place a strain on cellular networks depending on the work share between in vehicle and cloud computation GM s unlimited data plan could be a way to break it gently to the carriers that they re going to need a lot more data capacity soon
