AMD is coming out swinging against longtime competitor Intel with the launch of Ryzen its latest desktop PC processors based on the company s Zen chip architecture On Wednesday the Sunnyvale Calif based chipmaker announced details for three central processing units or CPUs under the Ryzen 7 brand that beat Intel s top PC chips in both price and performance The Ryzen chips all feature 8 cores and 16 threads They come in three tiers Using the popular CPU benchmark tool Cinebench AMD pitted the three processors against comparable Intel PC chips and the initial results look promising With Ryzen AMD hopes to reinvigorate a waning PC industry which has experienced overall annual decline in sales for the past five years Ryzen is more than just another processor launch boasted Jim Anderson senior vice president of computing and graphics at AMD at a Tuesday event in San Francisco It represent real innovation and competition in the high performance PC market Of course the chips aren t likely to kickstart demand for the PC the boom days are long gone But by introducing some competition into the market AMD hopes it can improve its market share and make high performance PCs more accessible to consumers Not only are gamers continually demanding higher performance but so are people editing and compiling videos and photos We re starting to see insatiable demand for better experiences when creating content said AMD CTO Mark Papermaster in an interview We have thousands of photos we want to edit and create photo albums for We re all becoming content creators The old low resolution displays are not good for any of us anymore We need more processing power AMD has had a rocky recent past While it competed successfully against Intel for many years up until the mid 2000s a string of duds brought the company to near extinction During that time Intel gobbled up CPU market share in both PCs and the data center Take a look at the PC market over the last two or three years it s starved for innovation and it has really stagnated said Anderson In the tech industry the worst thing is incrementalism That s what the market has been suffering from This has benefitted our competitor in their financials but it hasn t benefitted the industry and the end user Ryzen injects some real competition into the industry Ryzen is the initial step in a potential turnaround for AMD Wall Street is certainly betting on it AMD s stock is trading up more than 600 over the past 12 months AMD began building the architecture Ryzen is based on Zen four years ago Its original goal with Zen was to hit 40 more instructions per cycle which is a metric for processor performance over the previous generation s architecture Instead AMD ended up with 52 more instructions per cycle Typically most chips based on new architecture achieve only up to 20 jumps in performance The three Ryzen 7 processors are going up for pre orders on Wednesday and will launch globally on March 2nd More than 180 retailers and PC makers will support the new chips
