Visa NYSE V has just reported earnings and shares are set to move higher on the news for reasons I will discuss Recall that earlier this year I initiated coverage on Visa with a buy rating Since that time the stock has appreciated 20 Recall I like the name because it has been one that I have long done business with as a cardholder and as a business accepting Visa Then just last week we discussed what could be one of the biggest game changers for Visa and this drove the stock higher However what I think is most important is performance relative to expectations as well as policies related to dividends buybacks and the outlook for the name going forward That is the power of a name like Visa it has all of these and more That said Visa s just announced earnings show why it is a winner I am impressed because the results indicate that the company is still on a path of strong and reliable growth reinforcing my thesis on the name Net revenue for the quarter came in at 4 56 billion a solid 25 6 increase over fiscal Q3 2016 This was primarily due the inclusion of European operations as well as growth in the volume of processed transactions Processed transactions jumped 44 versus last year to 28 5 billion When we back out the inclusion of Europe we still see that processed transactions spiked 13 This is pretty sizable growth for a long standing company like Visa These revenues were up nicely and beat expectations by 200 million Of course with revenues rising so much we must be on the lookout for the impact on what it costs to produce those revenues I m taking about cost of sales Not surprisingly with the inclusion of European operations expenses rose significantly year over year But as previously discussed the primary takeaway here is whether that the pace of revenue increases was greater than the increase in expenses In this case we actually saw GAAP expenses drop 52 to 1 5 billion Don t get too excited Last year s quarter had major expenses related to acquiring the European business When we factor these in expenses were up 31 a bit higher than I would like to see Still these rising expenses were not enough to hit profits Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company it reported net income of 2 1 billion or 0 86 as reported Again the prior year s results included several special spending items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe Excluding these special items net income and earnings per share both increased 26 over the prior year Once again adjusting to a constant currency basis adjusted net income actually was up 28 year over year Earnings per share beat estimates by a strong margin of 0 05 All in all it was a strong quarter with higher transactions payment volume growth greater data processing and cross border volume growth all of which increased relative to last year independent of the European inclusion This is exactly the type of growth I want to see for Visa which is one of the stocks I have been most bullish on So what is the bottom line Stay long cause we re going over 100 This quarter continues a string of relatively solid quarters over the years The name is powerful and continues to take care of shareholders although I have argued for increased dividends despite this being a growth play Still there is a solid buyback and there is a dividend even if it is a small one During the quarter Visa bought back 17 8 million shares for approximately 1 7 billion The company now pays a 0 165 quarterly dividend or 0 66 annually This only translates to a 0 7 yield I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years but won t fuss considering where share prices are heading Stay long Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012 If you like the material and want to see more scroll to the top of the article and hit follow Quad 7 Capital also writes a lot of breaking articles which are time sensitive actionable investing ideas If you would like to be among the first to be updated be sure to check the box for Email alerts under Follow I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article
