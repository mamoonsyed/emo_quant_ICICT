Shares of Twitter TWTR are down 2 29 or 12 at 17 32 after the company this morning reported Q2 revenue and profit that topped analysts expectations and forecast adjusted profit this quarter but didn t show the user growth the Street wanted to see the top of the funnel as they say on the Street Chief executive and co founder Jack Dorsey touted the fact that the company s daily average users rose by double digits for the third quarter in a row although Twitter doesn t disclose the exact number of those daily users people who have been logged in to the site on a given day On a conference call however analysts wanted to know how Twitter would deal with the top of funnel problem Its total average monthly users or MAUs at 328 million rose by 5 from the prior year period and was flat with the prior quarter CFO Anthony Noto told user the assembled on the call that obviously our focus has been on daily active usage because as he put it they are the key driver of overall growth from an advertising standpoint Revenue in the three months ended in June declined by 5 year over year to 574 million yielding EPS of 8 cents Analysts had been modeling 537 million and 5 cents per share Twitter s adjusted Ebitda came in at 178 million up slightly from 175 million a year earlier For this quarter the company projected Ebitda in a range of 130 million to 150 million which which was a little bit below the average estimate per FactSet of 146 million Doug Anmuth of J P Morgan who has a Neutral rating on the shares called the results mixed noting the revenue and earnings beat but TWTR added no MAUs sequentially even as DAUs grew 12 Y Y The outlook for this quarter s Ebitda and the implied revenue is below what he s been modeling TWTR s implied revenue guide of 500M 600M based on an EBITDA margin of 25 26 JPMe 29 was also 9 3 below our consensus estimate of 606M 569M at the midpoint Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry on the call asked Noto whether advertising revenue has bottomed and got less than a fully clear answer Anthony user growth sorry the financial declines moderated this quarter Should we be thinking that advertising revenue growth particularly on a per user basis has sort of bottomed out here Sure Thank you Heath As I mentioned we re very excited about the third consecutive quarter double digit DAU growth at 12 year over year Because that bodes really well for future revenue growth We re also very pleased that we are able to seeing an inflection point in our total revenue growth improving from an 8 year over year decline in Q1 to a 5 year over year decline in Q2 And a 2 year over year decline when you exclude the contribution both which as you mentioned deemphasize and expect to be at 0 revenue in the fourth quarter While we still have a lot of work to do for revenue growth to track audience growth the improvements in revenue growth reflect the progress executing against our top revenue generating priorities in the second quarter as well as strengthening business fundamentals and I want to point out a couple of drivers that drove that inflection point First and foremost to the second quarter of accelerating year over year growth in the data business Second is continued strong growth in video with a very strong 2017 digital content new fronts Third is an improvement in our year over year growth rates for owned and operated revenue with linear improvement in spending across our existing global and U S upfront advertisers in both May and June compared to April Our DAU and social products performed better than expected while there were down year over year we re able to stem the decline and see an inflection point in those products as well And then just executing our team has done a great job of communicating the incremental value that we re driving this year than a year ago to the advertisers as a reflection of our audience growth our improved ad relevancy measured by rates and better pricing down more than 50 year over year In addition to that what Bruce recently joined us on our team on the revenue product has done a great job driving platform benefits We will note that one of the benefits that we saw throughout the quarter is a 10 increase in in ROI based on new platform changes to buy on interest basis and basis And so there s lot of iteration going underlying the products its also helping us As it relates to back half the year we did note that while we re encouraged by the improvement of overall revenue trends we don t expect to see revenue growth rates improve for the second half of 17 Because the headwinds you mentioned the 75 million That s primarily tied to the business but there s some other comparables they are difficult So the 75 million combination of products de emphasized and some tougher comps as it relates to live which we re encouraged we can continue to chip away given the we have So on a normalized basis just excluding 75 million headwind we could see improvement in total revenue growth by fourth quarter
