Qualcomm was hit with yet another record breaking fine by an Asian antitrust body yesterday as the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission TFTC announced its finding that the US chipmaker has abused its monopoly power The regulator levied a penalty of 23 4 billion New Taiwan Dollars which totals around 773 million In addition to the fine the statement released by the TFTC here in Chinese indicated that Qualcomm will be ordered to cease the following licensing practices The press release also reveals some interesting details about Qualcomm s licensing business in the market The violating licensing practices it says occurred over the past seven years During that time Qualcomm collected 400 billion New Taiwan Dollars in licensing fees from Taiwanese companies at today s exchange rates that s around 13 2 billion During the same span Taiwan based manufacturers purchased around 30 billion worth of baseband chips from the US company At first blush the ruling appears to be along similar lines as those handed down previously by China s National Development and Reform Commission NDRC and the Korean Fair Trade Commission KFTC Qualcomm holds big number of standard essential patents in CDMA WCDMA and LTE segments and is the dominant provider of CDMA WCDMA and LTE baseband chips one translation reported It abused its advantage in mobile communication standards refused to license necessary patents Qualcomm s global battle to defend its licensing practices from antitrust scrutiny has placed it at loggerheads with many of the biggest names in Taiwanese industry One of most notable rulings by the KFTC in its Qualcomm probe was that the US company must negotiate licences with competitors including Mediatek a Taiwanese company that is a fierce rival for mobile chipset sales Qualcomm s multijurisdictional legal battle with Apple has also seen four major Taiwanese contract manufacturers Foxconn Wistron Compal and Pegatron caught in the crossfire on the receiving end of Qualcomm lawsuits Seen through this lens the TFTC s tough stance isn t much of a surprise Qualcomm says it will ask Taiwanese courts to stay any behavioural remedies and overturn the large fine which it claims bears no rational relationship to its revenues in the market Its efforts to do the same regarding the KFTC s 900 million ruling in 2016 have so far been frustrated but the company announced in September that it was asking the Korea Supreme Court to intervene Whatever happens with the appeals the fact that the TFTC has shown its cards means there is one less major regulatory question mark for Qualcomm in Asia The focus of the antitrust war may shift to the US and EU going forward although there is still important Apple Qualcomm litigation going on in China Taiwan and Japan The IP and antitrust nexus will take centre stage later this month at IPBC Asia I will be moderating a panel that includes representatives from ZTE Intel and Conversant IP as well as distinguished antitrust law professor and attorney Kimitoshi Yabuki Thanks to Crystal Chen at Tsai Lee Chen in Taipei for providing help with translation
