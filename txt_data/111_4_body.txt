Twitter s revenue has fallen for the first time as advertisers have pulled back from the social media service favoured by Donald Trump celebrities and journalists However the Silicon Valley company which has never turned a profit cheered investors by announcing a significant rise in the number of monthly users to 328 million Shares in the company which hit a peak of 69 in 2014 rose by more than 10 to 16 14 on Wednesday as the revenue and user number figures exceeded analysts expectations Jack Dorsey Twitter s co founder and chief executive said he was proud to report that the number of active daily users had increased for the fourth consecutive quarter and was up 14 on this time last year But he conceded that the company which has never made a profit was still battling revenue headwinds The San Francisco based firm reported an 8 fall in first quarter revenue to 548m 427m It is the company s first fall in year on year quarterly revenue since it floated on the stock market in 2013 Advertising revenue for the three month period fell 11 to at 474m but the drop was softer than the 443m that analysts had predicted Some income from licensing deals increased The 11 year old company made a net quarterly loss of 62m an improvement on the 80m it lost in the first quarter of 2016 and much less than the 167m it lost in the previous quarter The loss amounts to almost 700 000 a day While we continue to face revenue headwinds we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term Dorsey said The company pointed to its success in increasing engagement from users on a daily basis but did not provide figures for the number of daily users It said monthly active users had increased by 6 over the past year to 328 million and the total stood more than 9 million higher than at the end of the previous quarter Mark Mahaney an analyst at RBC Capital Markerts said the increase in users could be your first indicator that revenue could recover some day But he said the issue for investors was When do things get less worse Twitter which was touted for sale last year but failed to find a buyer has been pushed into the spotlight as President Trump has used the service to get his message across directly to the electorate bypassing what he regards as the dishonest media both before and after the presidential election The company did not directly credit Trump for helping to drive user growth but said that new users tended to follow more political accounts Having the political leaders of the world as well as news agencies participating on Twitter is an important part of reinforcing engagement Anthony Noto Twitter s chief operating officer said Michael Pachter an analyst at Wedbush Securities said Trump drives a lot of awareness about Twitter among people who otherwise wouldn t be paying attention But again one quarter isn t a trend so let s see if it s sustainable Twitter reported that its recent foray into livestreaming had proved successful with more than 800 hours of live video broadcast across more than 450 events The company said the content had reached 45 million users a 31 increase on the previous quarter which was the first full quarter with livestreaming Despite advertisers appearing to cool their enthusiasm for the service Noto said the company still believed that Twitter is the best place to drive brand perception and we re continuing to showcase our unique value proposition for advertisers We ve received positive early feedback from our ad partners as we highlight the improved return on investment from our audience growth and better pricing We remain focused on our initiatives to grow revenue by simplifying our revenue product portfolio communicating our progress to advertisers and reallocating resources to our highest revenue generating priorities Last year Twitter shed about 350 jobs nearly a tenth of its workforce in an attempt to cut its costs and stem losses
