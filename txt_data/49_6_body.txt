Boston Scientific BSX slumps on increased volume in response to its announcement that it will voluntarily recall all Lotus Valve devices including Lotus with Depth Guard from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of a premature release of a pin connecting the valve to the delivery system It says the problem is most likely caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process The company expects to have the devices back on the market in Europe and other regions in Q4 the same time it plans to file a PMA in the U S If all goes well market launch will commence in mid 2018
