On October 17 International Business Machines IBM reported its Q3 2017 results beating on both EPS and revenue by 0 02 and 550 million respectively which surprised many analysts As a result the stock price soared by more than 5 to the level of 154 during post market trading hours breaking major resistance levels While the company s results are indeed promising and they show the signs of a turnaround investors should still remain cautious and watch closely the future development of the company If IBM shows similar performance at least over the next two to three quarters the fact of a turnaround will be confirmed In this article I provide the analysis of IBM s Q3 earnings and the outlook for the future of the corporation First of all let us look at the numbers Overall the company s revenue and EPS remained nearly flat vs the numbers of the same period in 2016 Hence it can be seen EPS increased by 0 01 year over year while sales decreased by 0 4 from 19 2 billion to 19 15 billion which is not a significant decline The Q3 revenue dynamics are presented by the graph below It is clear the growth has not been seen in Q3 over last three years The most important segment of IBM s revenue in Q3 was Strategic Imperatives Thus it is claimed Strategic Imperatives revenue increased by more than 10 in Q3 in constant currency with a strong double digit growth in cloud and security and an additional 1 growth was created by the currency tailwind The growth was driven by hybrid cloud offerings security and mobile As a result Strategic Imperatives now represents almost half of IBM s revenue which makes this segment even more crucial for the corporation s future It is important to note here that IBM does not differentiate Strategic Imperatives as a separate business but it represents a view of the revenue across segments that provide clients with analytics cloud security mobile and social capabilities As a result it can be difficult for investors to analyze what segments are experiencing growth Cognitive solutions revenue continued to demonstrate decent performance in Q3 The growth amounted to 4 YoY driven by solutions software including security and analytics and transaction processing software It should be noted Cognitive Solutions include such promising segments as Watson Health Internet of things IoT and some areas of cloud computing Notably the company claimed to sign 40 new customers to the IoT platform during the quarter Therefore I believe the fact that this segment shows strong performance reveals that IBM has opportunities to be a major player in future in such areas as IoT and AI It is stated by Market Realist As a result it can be expected the company s revenue will be positively impacted by the segment of Cognitive Solutions in the coming years which means investors should monitor future developments in this area Moreover IBM continued to successfully convert net income to free cash flow with cash flow realization at 96 over the last 12 months This reduces the level of an overall financial risk for the company especially in light of the fact that IBM continues paying relatively high dividends Moreover it is clear the corporation will need a lot of cash to be able to invest in certain fields such as AI and IoT in order to stay competitive in the market In addition what I find encouraging is the new partnership with Volkswagen OTCPK VLKAY the biggest automaker in 2016 It is revealed IBM will collaborate with VW on new mobility services and provide its cloud and cognitive capabilities to create highly personalized digital experiences for drivers In my article on Ford s new strategy I already mentioned that the auto market is likely to experience dramatic changes due to higher digitalization and increasing popularity of ride hailing services like Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT The changes will create new opportunities for the corporations from the tech and traditional auto industries and bring new sources of revenue Therefore the fact that IBM teams up with Volkswagen OTCPK VLKAY which generated more than 217 billion in revenue in 2016 means IBM is likely to profit significantly from the digitalization in the auto industry Although IBM demonstrated better than expected Q3 results there are still reasons to remain cautious about the corporation First of all such revenue segments as Global Business Services and Technology Services and Cloud Platforms continued to decline in Q3 The two segments combined were responsible for more than 65 of IBM s revenue in the quarter Moreover the company s margins decreased significantly in Q3 2017 compared with the margins in 2016 As a result despite the fact that revenues declined only 0 4 year over year operating income suffered a 6 decline in the quarter At The same time IBM remains optimistic about the future development of this indicator In addition the corporation s long term debt increased significantly from 37 612 million in Q2 2017 to more than 41 000 million in Q3 2017 IBM s debt to cash ratio is at the level of 4 while debt to total equity in balance sheet terms is more than 2 5 which is worse than the industry average Finally even though both EPS and revenue were better than expected in Q3 2017 the company was not able to return to growth which means it s now been 22 straight quarters of declining revenue for the tech giant Overall IBM demonstrated solid results in Q3 2017 beating on EPS and revenue The results were driven by such segments as Cognitive Solutions and Strategic Imperatives which include businesses like AI IoT and cloud As a result while there are still reasons to remain cautious about IBM investors can be moderately optimistic about the future of the company IBM shares continue to trade at a relatively low P S ratio which shows there is still room to grow My fundamental analysis of IBM stock with a detailed DCF model can be found in my previous article on IBM here
