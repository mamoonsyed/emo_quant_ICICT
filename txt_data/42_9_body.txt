Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices AMD are up 1 04 or 7 at 15 15 retreating from the highest levels of last night s after hours gains after the company beat with its Q2 results and forecast this quarter higher as well and raised its growth outlook for the year Following the report chief executive Lisa Su defended the value of her company s young product line against the empire of Intel s INTC dominance in PCs and data center There are no ratings changes today that I can see just some price target increases here and there The bulls are delighted with the progress they see with new products such as Ryzen for PCs and the beginning of revenue for the company s Epyc server chip Bears confess being impressed but mostly think the stock is overvalued Even though the compony delivered a profit surprise last night there was some acknowledgement AMD s operating expenses are going higher which bulls see as worth it Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities reiterates a Buy rating and raises his price target to 22 from 20 writing that We are particularly intrigued about the incremental investment AMD is making in the data center in 1H17 in CPU GPU compute an area unique to AMD vs both Intel and Nvidia We think we are in the early innings of an AMD x86 cycle writes Mosesmann that could be as big as the 2003 06 cycle that culminated with AMD capturing nearly 25 of all x86 unit CPU sales Mosesmann thinks the company is gaining share in graphics chips versus Nvidia NVDA and he notes AMD itself is notbanking on crypto currency a reference to the fact some have presumed its strength comes from mining Ether and Bitcoin Computing and Graphics Sales were 659 million in the quarter up 11 se quentially on both CPU and GPU strength Momentum is set to continue for new CPU Ryzen as lower end Ryzen 3 Ryzen mobile and gaming centric Threadripper have yet to ship and will do so in 3Q17 In GPUs we believe AMD gained share with the new Polaris mid to high tier GPU and will re enter the high end with Vega GPU in 3Q17 as well The crypto currency segment of the GPU market is playing a role in GPU upside and is a dynamic to follow closely however AMD is making strides to make sure that GPUs that sell into those markets are not useful in gaming segments Additionally AMD is conser vatively assuming crypto is not included as a driver for GPU growth in 4Q17 and beyond for their forecasting Canaccord Genuity s Matthew Ramsay reiterates a Buy rating and a 20 price target writing that the company s turnaround is gaining steam even though he acknowledges operating expenses ramped sharply versus our expectation The company s forecast for non GAAP operating expenses this quarter was 400 million notes Ramsay above what he was modeling at 376 million but we applaud the investment even if it means near term leverage is limited Ramsay defends the company s issuing converts as a smart way to shore up the balance sheet The impact of convertible debt shares added roughly 100M shares to the forward diluted share count and served as a 0 03 headwind to 2017 EPS and a 0 04 impact to 2018 results Despite this impact we remind investors of the significant impact to quarterly interest expense down roughly 105M annually the health of the balance sheet and manufacturing flexibility the recent share count dilutive actions have given the company Without these in aggregate we believe AMD s turnaround would have proven significantly more challenging John Pitzer with Credit Suisse reiterates a Neutral rating and a 10 50 price target writing that while management continues to execute well to targets that appear reasonable CY17 guide implies only seasonal C4Q of down 10 q q current valuation of 27 4 times EV EBITDA needs to eventually be supported by better profitability and even against target model of 14 OpM stock appears fairly valued at 9 0 times CY21 EV EBITDA Morgan Stanley s Joseph Moore reiterates an Equal Weight rating and an 11 price target writing that fundamental progress has been impressive but we don t see earnings growing into the stock price and we maintain a cautious view We re still above AMD s forecast for 2h17 and ahead of the street for next year slightly But as we move deeper into these product ramps the street is catching up quickly And at 0 32 in EPS for next year the only rationale for the stock price at current levels is that 2018 represents the beginning of a multiyear revenue ramp back to 2006 market share levels which in our view gives Intel no credit for being able to compete effectively despite migrating to 10 nm in 2018 Even in 2h17 Intel will become more competitive with a 15 20 performance boost in desktop and a material jump in server performance with Purley We still maintain that 300 mm is the right server number for Epyc in 2018 even after a very impressive launch highlighting several wins MKM Partners s Ruben Roy reiterates a Neutral rating on the stock and a 13 price target writing While we continue to appreciate AMD s execution we still see shares as appropriately valued at current levels AMD shares peaked at 3 0x EV forward sales at the height of its server market share in 2006 and have averaged roughly 2 0x EV to forward sales in growth periods over the past 20 years We maintain our fair value estimate of 13 which is based on the midpoint of these two levels or roughly 2 5x enterprise value on our 2018 revenue estimate Roy raises estimates for next year to 5 49 billion in revenue and 29 cents EPS versus a prior 5 22 billion and 27 cents
