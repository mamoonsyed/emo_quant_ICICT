Tesla shares have been on an epic run since the beginning of the year up 50 at one point They re still way up but since fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings were reported last week the stock has been getting clobbered On Monday Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino who has assumed Tesla coverage duties from Patrick Archambault downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and dropped his target price to 185 from an already bearish 190 Shares were down 5 in early action on Monday to 244 Tamberrino focused on the factors that have typically fueled the bear case for Tesla which in any case has always been a volatile stock prone to wild spikes and swoons of the sort we re witnessing His note highlighted potential issues with the company s cash burn the difficulties of integrating SolarCity after a 2 1 billion acquisition last year and most importantly the expectation that the Model 3 mass market vehicles won t launch as scheduled in 2017 or achieve sufficient production to move the needle for investors Here s the salient language on the Model 3 from the note We believe the Model 3 will have a more subdued launch curve than the company is targeting as some suppliers have expressed concern around final designs not being locked down As a result we expect the company to achieve mass market volumes i e above 100k annualized run rate in 4Q18 vs Tesla s target of 4Q17 Historical operational execution also points to a more gradual production ramp though we do expect some improvement from the Model X than Tesla is guiding Further as we break down the componentry costs for Tesla s vehicles we find that the Model 3 should contribute negative operating margins until the company can break the 100k per year unit mark we forecast in 2019 and or lower battery cost to 100 kWh we currently forecast this to occur by 2020E even at an average price of 45k which we assume is the likely selling price above the 35k base given the technology and hardware packages for the vehicle Goldman has generally edged toward the bearish side of Tesla prognostication or occupied a middle ground relative to other firms whose price targets have at times been above 400 Tesla has never broken through the 300 barrier although it has come close There s no question that Tesla will launch the Model 3 in late 2017 but it s also unlikely that production will ramp quickly until some point in 2018 What s more Tesla will still spend much of its cash on hand about 3 5 billion to launch the Model 3 So Tamberrino s general bearishness is justified and from the point of view of an investor responsible His call on the stock price is consistent with previous Tesla slides and at the moment a Tesla sell off makes sense given how much shares surged over the first two months of 2017 unmotivated by any substantial events Profit taking is entirely justified Right now the Tesla bulls and bears are divided over the Model 3 That makes sense but there are varieties of division Some analysts assume that the disruptive potential of a 35 000 Tesla is considerable and although the company might be able to cash in right away on its nearly 400 000 preorders for the car the writing is on the wall More circumspect analysts such as Tamberrino assume that the Model 3 launch and rollout will be as messy as with Tesla s previous vehicles Tamberrino also argues that Tesla s shift from a niche luxury automaker to a mass market car company isn t necessarily the best thing for the bottom line and that s before we even deal with the solar business the energy storage business or the building of a massive battery factory in Nevada The story here is that the pullback from the early 2017 rally was inevitable given that Tesla wasn t in a good position to offer a surprise profit for Q4 as it did in Q3 In retrospect a potential tax cut and President Donald Trump s made in USA manufacturing policies couldn t justify a Tesla market cap that was within a few billion of Ford s Once attention returned to the Model 3 as well as the challenges of the SolarCity deal and the accelerating cash burn in 2017 the downgrades and price target reassessments on Wall Street could begin The question isn t how far the stock will drop it often falls pretty far but rather how robustly it would recover if the Model 3 hits the streets on schedule by the end of the year That s what Wall Street will spend 2017 trying to figure out Get the latest Goldman Sachs stock price here
