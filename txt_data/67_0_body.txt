As reported yesterday for the first time in 13 years broke their streak of quarterly revenue growth The revenue decline is being attributed to slowing iPhone sales and overall macro economic trends i e China In an otherwise gloomy report there was a surprising bright spot Apple Music subscriptions have surpassed the 13 million mark up from the 11 million announced two months ago In thinking through how to explain this accelerating rise it s relevant to remember that the Apple Music launch was far from perfect In this space for instance I wrote an article entitled Apple Music Betrays Apple s Brilliance By Ignoring The Harry Potter Theory Of Marketing in which I expressed my disappointment that Apple a company that is able to create perceived value around products better than any other firm elected not to attempt to do so with respect to music If any company is capable of creating perceived value by de emphasizing features and highly emphasizing the way in which a product makes the user feel better about themselves for having used the product it s Apple It s too bad for Apple for music and for musicians that they don t appear to be applying the same ingenuity to music as they do for their other products I d love to see what they would come up with if they did I elaborated on this sentiment in a piece entitled The Real Message In Taylor Swift s Open Letter To Apple Music Be More Like Me by using Taylor Swift s Open Letter to Apple with respect to the duration of their free trials by stating Ms Swift has every right to be frustrated by Apple s stance on free trials as she has created massive perceived value in her music enabling her to avoid the plights of commoditization that have plagued other artists Apple has generated enormous profits by avoiding the perils of commoditization via innovative product design and marketing In this manner they ve convinced people to pay for something that they could get at a cheaper price or free Streaming services have not been able to do this Most customers cannot tell the difference between the various streaming services and therefore dominantly make their choice based on which is cheapest what they re already using Now it appears that Apple may very well be creating this perceived value in the eyes of customers which is resulting in distinguishing their product from others reducing churn and growing subscribers There have been a number of theories to explain how this differentiation is taking place but they seem to coalesce around recommendations This is particularly surprising in light of the fact that the killer app that was the apparent differentiator was the to my ears unlistenable Beats1 radio product while I increasingly hear people talk about Apple Music s recommendations I have heard zero mention of Beats1 either in the press or amongst my large number of music loving acquaintances students in ages In February Jim Dalrymple wrote of this suprisingly improved curation in The Loop Mr Dalrymple s experiences mirror my own Over the past months I increasingly found myself checking the For You section of Music and being entertained surprised and occasionally delighted while having precisely the opposite experience with Spotify I eventually grew so fatigued by the convoluted Spotify UI and non value adding recommendations that I cancelled my paid subscription to Spotify and went all in with Apple Music In talking to others about my decision dominantly my students I found that I was not alone in becoming frustrated by Spotify and growing enamored of Apple Music One of my students summed it up Spotify is becoming like MySpace while Apple Music is more like In further parsing this statement the analogy however unscientifically derived has some relevance Facebook was in part able to eclipse MySpace by offering a more controlled and thus aesthetically pleasing and functional UI Recall for instance the ways in which MySpace allowed users to hack pimp their pages and how this decision resulted in both an un navigable mess and slow load times Facebook on the other hand severely limited personalization and instead focused on providing relevant content Apple Music s UI and particularly the For You section is simple and straightforward in its layout and function Further it is updated with enough regularity that checking in a few times a day frequently results in the same slight dopamine hit of pleasure that for many causes them to recurrently check their Facebook page There are likely many other reasons why Apple Music s subscriber base is growing and never forget that Apple Music lacks the economic imperatives that Spotify and others have But Apple Music s subscriber growth particularly when buttressed against Spotify s recent cash raise under terms described as ugly exploitative shows that perhaps Apple Music may well be on a path to provide real value to customers and I sincerely hope to artists and avoid the plight of commoditization and the fate of MySpace
