Boston Scientific Corporation NYSE BSX shares are up more than 36 89 this year and recently decreased 0 64 or 0 19 to settle at 29 61 Abbott Laboratories NYSE ABT on the other hand is up 44 47 year to date as of 10 25 2017 It currently trades at 55 49 and has returned 0 50 during the past week Boston Scientific Corporation NYSE BSX and Abbott Laboratories NYSE ABT are the two most active stocks in the Medical Appliances Equipment industry based on today s trading volumes Investors are clearly interested in the two names but is one a better choice than the other We will compare the two companies across growth profitability risk valuation and insider trends to answer this question One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time Analysts expect BSX to grow earnings at a 10 84 annual rate over the next 5 years Comparatively ABT is expected to grow at a 11 50 annual rate All else equal ABT s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation Growth in and of itself is not necessarily valuable and it can even be harmful to shareholders if companies overinvest in unprofitable projects in pursuit of that growth We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment ROI which adjust for differences in capital structure as measure of profitability and return compared to an EBITDA margin of 19 84 for Abbott Laboratories ABT BSX s ROI is 5 10 while ABT has a ROI of 6 70 The interpretation is that ABT s business generates a higher return on investment than BSX s The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock BSX s free cash flow FCF per share for the trailing twelve months was 0 08 Comparatively ABT s free cash flow per share was On a percent of sales basis BSX s free cash flow was 1 31 while ABT converted 0 of its revenues into cash flow This means that for a given level of sales BSX is able to generate more free cash flow for investors Analysts look at liquidity and leverage ratios to assess how easily a company can cover its liabilities BSX has a current ratio of 0 70 compared to 2 90 for ABT This means that ABT can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months BSX s debt to equity ratio is 0 81 versus a D E of 0 76 for ABT BSX is therefore the more solvent of the two companies and has lower financial risk BSX trades at a forward P E of 21 10 a P B of 5 61 and a P S of 4 64 compared to a forward P E of 19 68 a P B of 3 06 and a P S of 3 81 for ABT BSX is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings book value and sales basis Given that earnings are what matter most to investors analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P E A cheap stock is not necessarily a value stock Most of the time a stock is cheap for good reason A stock only has value if the current price is substantially below the price at which it should trade in the future BSX is currently priced at a 4 55 to its one year price target of 31 02 Comparatively ABT is 8 7 relative to its price target of 60 78 This suggests that ABT is the better investment over the next year The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 1 being a strong buy 3 a hold and 5 a sell is 1 90 for BSX and 2 00 for ABT which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for ABT Beta is a metric that investors frequently use to analyze a stock s systematic risk A beta above 1 implies above average market volatility Conversely a stock with a beta below 1 is seen as less risky than the overall market BSX has a beta of 1 02 and ABT s beta is 1 57 BSX s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks Short interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment It represents the percentage of a stock s tradable shares that are being shorted BSX has a short ratio of 3 07 compared to a short interest of 2 77 for ABT This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for ABT Abbott Laboratories NYSE ABT beats Boston Scientific Corporation NYSE BSX on a total of 9 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks ABT is more profitable generates a higher return on investment higher liquidity and has lower financial risk In terms of valuation ABT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings book value and sales basis ABT is more undervalued relative to its price target Finally ABT has better sentiment signals based on short interest
