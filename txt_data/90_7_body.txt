Jeff Bezos has figured what Amazon needs and it includes a steady supply of kale quinoa and wild Atlantic salmon In a startling announcement Friday the Seattle based Web giant said it will buy Whole Foods for 13 7 billion the largest acquisition by far in Amazon s 22 year history dwarfing its 1 2 billion purchase of Zappos in 2009 The surprise deal came as a relief for Whole Foods CEO John Mackey who lately has been under pressure from Jana Partners to raise the fancy supermarket s stock price This week Mackey griped to the media that the hedge fund was run by greedy bastards Jana which took a 9 percent stake in Whole Foods in April is set to clear upward of 300 million on its trade Some analysts Friday speculated that a bidding war for Whole Foods might enlarge Jana s bonanza further still But bagging Whole Foods also comes as a big relief for Amazon s Bezos whose high tech efforts in food selling have met with hiccups most recently in the glitch ridden debut of its Amazon Go convenience store prototype Despite its dominance in books electronics and its prowess selling streaming music and movies on its Prime service the online behemoth s Amazon Fresh grocery service hasn t posed much of a threat to brick and mortar grocers That includes arch rival Walmart which is food retailing s biggest US player with an estimated 18 percent share of an 800 billion market But with the acquisition of Whole Foods and its 450 stores across the US all of that is about to change industry experts predict Wall Street appeared to agree as the stock prices of major food retailers got hammered across the board Friday see article below Amazon does not excel at procuring fresh foods but Whole Foods does said supermarket expert Josh Goldberg a managing director at Financo The two of them can do together what neither of them does well alone and that is procure high quality food at the right price Some experts predict Amazon will be cautious with any further retail rollout continuing to beef up the sophistication of its online operations But Richard Feinberg a professor of consumer science at Purdue University predicts that an Amazon owned Whole Foods will expand its chain much more quickly because of the financial power of Amazon Amazon understands data mining and has the expertise to do it Feinberg says This will help Whole Foods understand its customer better and have the right products at the right price at the right time Marc Wulfraat president of MWPVL a logistics and distribution consulting firm in Quebec said buying Whole Foods will in turn beef up its ability to deliver fresh food efficiently Whole Foods has 11 distribution centers across the country Wulfraat notes Instead of Amazon buying groceries from other retailers like it does currently a Whole Foods distribution center could send truck loads to the Amazon locations The surprise buy clobbered the stocks of supermarkets and other big food sellers as Wall Street panicked that the tie up will painfully disrupt the profit challenged grocery sector Shares of Target briefly plunged more than 12 percent before ending the day down 5 percent as investors weighed how much customer overlap the cheap chic discounter has with Amazon and Whole Foods Costco and Walmart also saw their stocks pounded 7 2 percent and 4 6 percent respectively as analysts squabbled over how vulnerable their massive stores might be to an Amazon backed Whole Foods retail machine A few tried to look on the bright side for Walmart arguing for example that the Amazon Whole Foods merger won t necessarily create a company that immediately competes against the Arkansas based discounter The Whole Foods shopper is not the Walmart shopper noted Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom One customer enjoys an annual income of 100K and the other pulls in 40 50K Worst hit was Kroger whose shares tumbled 9 percent Friday after plunging 19 percent a day earlier on disappointing sales and earnings which were chalked up to brutal price competition across the industry The major supermarket chains have to be scared out of their minds said David Tawil of hedge fund Maglan Capital Most have already been playing defense as more shoppers buy goods online in a sector that has profit margins typically ranging between 1 and 2 percent Amazon s entry into brick and mortar retailing isn t going to make things any easier industry experts say
