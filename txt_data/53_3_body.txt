year primarily driven by strong sales growth Full year 2016 adjusted EPS came in at 2 89 up 24 5 year over year The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 3 Per management strong sales of transcatheter valves drove the bottom line Excluding one time items net income in the fourth quarter improved 12 6 or 14 1 year over year to 158 5 million or 73 cents per share respectively For full year 2016 net income improved 15 1 or 16 year over year to 569 5 million or 2 61 per share respectively Edwards Lifesciences fourth quarter sales improved 14 4 to 767 7 million The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 759 million Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve THV sales as well as strong performance by the Critical Care segment Full year 2016 revenues totaled 2 96 billion which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 7 In the fourth quarter underlying sales increased 15 excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the THV sales return reserve In the U S sales rose 20 7 year over year to 421 5 million on an underlying basis In the international market underlying sales grew 8 8 to 346 2 million In the fourth quarter gross margin contracted 157 basis points bps to 72 2 owing to reduced year over year benefit from foreign exchange hedge contracts and manufacturing expenses associated with capacity expansion This was however partially offset by a profitable product mix SG A expenses rose 5 1 year over year to 233 6 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses primarily in the Transcatheter Valve THV segment partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax On the other hand R D expenditures increased 17 year over year to 114 9 million owing to continued investments in the company s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs including expenditure on clinical trials Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 81 bps to 26 8 as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses Edwards Lifesciences exited fiscal 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of 1 27 billion up from 1 22 billion at the end of 2015 Long term debt for full year 2016 was 822 3 million compared with 596 9 million at the end of the prior year Cash flow from operating activities was 201 1 million in the fourth quarter Excluding capital spending of 63 2 million free cash flow was 137 9 million During the fourth quarter management repurchased approximately 2 7 million shares for 246 million largely to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition which closed on Jan 23 Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million Edwards Lifesciences issued guidance for 2017 For full year 2017 the company expects sales in the range of 3 0 3 4 billion The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenue is 3 22 billion which is above the guidance range Adjusted EPS is expected around 3 30 3 45 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year adjusted EPS is 3 38 which is within the company s guidance range For the first quarter of 2017 the company projects sales between 760 million and 800 million and adjusted earnings per share between 79 cents and 89 cents ZCE Edwards Lifesciences ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with both earnings and revenue beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate Strong transcatheter valve sales drove the top and the bottom line significantly We are currently looking forward to the continued strong global adoption of the company s SAPIEN 3 platform However the company continued to perform poorly on its gross margin front On the other hand although Edwards Lifesciences higher operating expenses might have irked investors it is a relief to know that the higher expenses were on account of advanced initiatives adopted by the company to drive overall sales Nevertheless management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences leading to strong adoption of its THV therapy Edwards
