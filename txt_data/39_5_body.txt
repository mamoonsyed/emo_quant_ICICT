It s a big week for Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ The company s share price has skyrocketed from around 2 a year ago to above 15 50 this week ahead of the launch of its new Ryzen processors The launch of the new chips has been a highly anticipated event and market expectations are clearly sky high Unfortunately as seasoned traders know sky high expectations can often spell trouble for red hot stocks In fact there are at least three good reasons that AMD stock investors should consider cashing out of their positions now Wall Street analysts are projecting that Ryzen processors will drive 32 year over year revenue growth for AMD by fiscal Q2 That s certainly some impressive growth Unfortunately all of that revenue growth and much much more has already been priced into AMD stock Incredibly AMD s market cap has increased nearly sixfold in the past year It s going to take a lot of quarters of 30 sales growth to justify 594 market cap growth Even with the impressive projected growth numbers analysts are currently only calling for EPS of 1 cent per share by fiscal Q2 They aren t projecting Advanced Micro Devices will turn a profit until fiscal Q3 at 7 cents per share That would represent AMD s first profit in years Despite the generous growth projections AMD s forward price to earnings ratio currently sits at a bloated 49 5 If Ryzen falls short of projections that number could end up even higher At this point Ryzen may need to deliver sales numbers well above and beyond the market s expectations to even justify the stock s current share price At the stock s current share price it s hard to make a case for additional upside in the near term Sometimes it doesn t matter how well the launch of a new product performs traders still see the event as a selling opportunity A great example of this sell the news mentality is Nintendo Co Ltd ADR OTCMKTS sell off following the release of the Super Mario Run game in December After NTDOY s Pokemon GO momentum dried up investors were banking on big numbers from Super Mario Run When the game launched it surged to the top of the download charts and broke international revenue records Within a matter of days NTDOY stock was down more than 11
