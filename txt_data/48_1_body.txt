release Use of Non GAAP Financial Information A reconciliation of the company s non GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures and an explanation of the company s use of these non GAAP financial measures is included in the exhibits attached to this news release An explanation of the company s use of these non GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of this document An explanation of the company s use of these non GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of this document Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements presented on a GAAP basis we disclose certain non GAAP financial measures including adjusted net income earnings and adjusted net income earnings per share that exclude certain amounts and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and or the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales These non GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share To calculate adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to U S dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this constant currency growth rate and or growth rates excluding the impacts of recent acquisitions with significant sales is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis Reconciliations of each of these non GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules Management uses these supplemental non GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources In addition management uses these non GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments With the exception of the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales the adjustments excluded from our non GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance We believe that presenting adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and or the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non GAAP financial measures for the three and twelve months ended December 31 2016 and 2015 and for the forecasted three month period ending March 31 2017 and for the forecasted full year ending December 31 2017 as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items Adjusted Net Sales Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and or the Impact of Recent Acquisitions with Significant Sales Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and or the impacts of recent acquisitions with significant sales are not in accordance with U S GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures Further other companies may calculate these non GAAP financial measures differently than we do which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes To view the original version on PR Newswire visit http www prnewswire com news releases boston scientific announces results for fourth quarter and full year ended december 31 2016
