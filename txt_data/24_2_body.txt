Netflix NFLX reported a massive subscriber beat Monday with global net streaming additions coming in at 5 2MM versus a forecast of 3 2MM by the company last quarter What I found more interesting though was that Netflix was able to achieve this massive beat while still posting in line revenues They had guided to 2 755MM and came in at 2 785MM across all segments including DVD The breakdown of the guidance vs results is shown in the table below All values are in millions So what gives How come they beat so big on one metric while having minimal impact on their financials One small detail is that while their overall streaming subscriptions grew by 5 2MM users their paid subscriptions only grew by 4 68MM However even this number fails to account for the difference in revenue beyond one month at best even assuming all the subscriptions were at their lowest tier Clearly a lot of these subscribers joined towards the end of the quarter where they were either still on the free trial or had subscribed for a single month at the time of reporting One of the reasons investors are very happy today is because the domestic streaming segment added 1 07MM users in Q2 vs only 0 16MM last year At the face of it this seems to indicate that this segment is far from reaching saturation which would be considered very bullish for the company Is this really the case though What I found interesting is the total paid subscriptions in the US came in at 50 32MM very close to the estimate of 50 23MM The big beat in this segment is really from subscriptions that are currently in the trial period Earlier Monday I wrote an article talking about how Netflix is spending an ever increasing amount of marketing dollars to acquire the incremental subscriber As of Q1 the overall incremental cost of a new subscriber stood at 54 2 for the entire streaming segment Now I would like to point you specifically to what they spent on marketing in the Domestic streaming segment to achieve this beat Netflix spent 113 6MM towards marketing in the US in Q2 to attract their 1 07MM incremental subscribers This comes up to 106 16 for every incremental subscriber What logical sense does it make to spend so much money to acquire subscribers for a low cost streaming service Could it be that Netflix knows most of the people following the stock are only looking at the subscriber numbers and wanted to make sure they beat match their guidance before the quarter was up If they had spent 100MM more on marketing I m sure they would have been able to attract even more subscribers Would that mean the stock should then be bid up another 5 How much churn are we seeing in the domestic segment Netflix ended Q1 with 49 38MM domestic paying subs compared to 49 43 total domestic subs at the end of Q4 Let us consider this a starting point and say for the sake of argument that the 49 38MM represents the conversion of all free subscribers at the end of Q4 to paid subscriptions with zero churn Now in Q1 they had net adds of 1 42MM however their Q2 results show that domestic paid subs only stood at 50 32MM That is a difference of 0 48MM subscribers Again for Q3 they are guiding for a further addition of 0 75MM subs after adding 1 07MM subs in Q2 but the paid subscriptions are only expected to grow 1MM to 51 32MM subs That does seem to indicate some pretty significant churn does it not How is Netflix expecting to make a return on the massive amounts of marketing spend if it cannot retain the customers long enough to make it a profitable acquisition The market is overly focused on a single metric subscriber growth when it comes to Netflix The problem is that this metric is ripe for manipulation Investors need to understand that when a company beats on a single metric with no impact to anything else something looks fishy While investors are currently happy ignoring the massive cash burn and lack of profits this cannot last long Netflix has now become a very good short candidate I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure The Content provided in this article should be used for informational and educational purposes only and is not intended to provide tax legal insurance investment or financial advice and the content is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice Always seek the advice of a relevant professional with any questions about any financial legal or other decision you are seeking to make Any views expressed by Laxman Vembar are his own and do not necessarily reflect the view opinions and positions of FundamentalSpeculation IO Finally you should not rely solely on the information provided by the models on FundamentalSpeculation IO in making investment decisions but you should consider this information in the context of all information available to you
