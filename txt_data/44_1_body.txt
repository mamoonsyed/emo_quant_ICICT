Momentum lovers are salivating over Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ shares today The high octane chip company is soaring 5 6 amid heavy accumulation Resistance levels are melting in the face of AMD s fiery flight and if its luck holds this could be the start of a new uptrend My search for a news catalyst came up empty handed so it appears today s rally is nothing more than a chance meeting of buyers the world over From a volatility perspective AMD shares were becoming quite compressed Such periods are often the calm before the storm But in this case we re talking a good profit laced storm The classic example is to view the recent price action in AMD as a coiled spring All the pent up energy needs is a whiff of buying to breach resistance and then watch out above Resistance in this instance came in the form of the 50 day moving average which short of one failed breakout attempt last month has kept a lid on AMD for a spell Time will tell if today s breakout can go the distance but there s no denying the wind is at buyers backs right now In sizing up potential targets the next two resistance levels worth watching are 14 25 and then 15 25 The cheap price tag of Advanced Micro Devices obviously makes a straight stock purchase a viable choice But if you re looking to reduce the cost even further consider buying the Nov 13 calls for 1 25 The risk as with all option purchases is limited to the initial trade cost The 1 25 will be lost if AMD sits below 13 at expiration To minimize the damage I suggest exiting the trade if AMD breaks support at 12 45 Consider taking profits if the stock lifts to the 14 25 resistance level And keep in mind an earnings announcement is scheduled for Oct 26 so be sure to exit beforehand if you re not willing to roll the dice into the event As of this writing Tyler Craig didn t hold any positions in any of the aforementioned securities Want to learn how to master the art of option selling for high probability cash flow Check out Tyler s recently released video series through Tackle Trading on how to systematically sell iron condors for monthly income
