Twitter Inc NYSE TWTR stock was spiking on Wednesday morning after the market opened While the reason for the massive jump wasn t obvious right away a new report on the firm s ad business combined with sentiment may have done enough to set off a buying spree At time of writing shares in the micro blogging platform were trading up by more than 6 percent The spike brought shares to a price of 18 06 Shares have been higher in the last twelve months hitting over 25 at one point but this is still a significant rise for the dour firm The exact reason for the spike in the value of the firm wasn t clear There was no obvious chatter about an acquisition or any other big change at time of writing Despite the lack of concrete news driving the shares higher there were plenty of unsubstantiated rumors doing the rounds If you listen to the firm s own less than reliable social network everyone from Facebook to Blackberry is about to buy the firm In a report released on Wednesday morning analysts from Cleveland research said that they thought the firm s stock is bottoming out In their view there are three main reasons the company is likely to do better in the long term than it has since going public First of all Twitter is taking constructive feedback more seriously The firm has been showing signs that it s listening to its critics and putting together a growth framework that makes sense Second the firm has cut costs making retain on investment ROI better possibly in the long term Finally Cleveland believes that the feedback the firm is getting on its ad sales is the best it s had in more than 2 years If advertisers reckon Twitter is a platform worth selling on that can only be good for the firm The Cleveland report warns that there may still be problems in the near term Competition over ad sales and the firm s need to prove its efficacy means that there are sales headwinds for the time being Cleveland was cautiously optimistic in its report on Twitter this morning and it seems strange that a report like that could evoke such a strong reaction There are very few firms on Wall Street who are optimistic on Twitter and that hasn t really changed all that much of late Cleveland isn t the only firm that thinks Twitter Inc NYSE TWTR is doing well recently but most of Wall Street is still cautious about the future of Jack Dorsey s undertaking Almost all of those who currently have a rating on the firm have set it at Hold over the next twelve months The highest price target for Twitter shares on Wall Street sits at 25 while the mean sits at just 15 Earlier in June Barclays raised its price target in order to meat that mean This morning s price spike puts that at well above the mean outlook on Wall Street something that should cause investors to question the big swing in the firm s value Wall Street isn t even looking to see major increases in earnings at the firm this year According to the Financial Times the mean estimate of 2017 EPS comes in at 33 cents In 2018 the Street is only expecting that number to rise to 39 cents per share Meanwhile the same group of analysts is expecting to see the firm s sales actually fall this year compared to the year just gone The consensus sales estimate comes in at 2 33bn for 2017 down from 2 55bn in 2016 Twitter actually managed to beat the estimates last year on sales posting an actual number of 2 53bn Even that couldn t make Wall Street more optimistic about the long term however Twitter Inc NYSE TWTR stock hasn t managed to peak above 20 per share since a brief period in September 2016 Even with this morning s jump in value the firm is still far away from that target If Cleveland is right about the firm s ad business Twitter might just be able to improve for the longer term There s no guarantee of that of course and the firm is certainly a risky prospect Unless a buyer comes along something the firm has investigated in the past there is no sign of a fast turnaround in the value of the stock Putting money on an ad business that has been nothing but trouble over the last decade is certainly a murky prospect Twitter has failed one too many times in a very competitive market Most of those watching tech stocks don t seem to have all that much faith in management The platform still has strong engagement Though user growth has slowed the firm is still managing to develop its business Right now however Wall Street wants to see financial growth That is still something that seems quite a way away even with the Cleveland report taken at face value That said the firm s shares have been on the upswing in recent months after plummeting to painful lows at the start of 2017 Those with money in Twitter Inc NYSE TWTR can t be happy with the firm s performance since it became a public company There has been a big rally in tech stocks in recent days after a sell off last week Twitter however has become disconnected from the pack Because the firm has been losing money and has a poor growth outlook investors don t put it in the same group as the FANG stocks or any other Wall Street acronym With the release of the Cleveland report on Tuesday however the conditions may have been just right for Twitter stock With a bubbly tech atmosphere and some growth positive news traders may have looked at Twitter Inc stock this morning and thought it was time Or if you re more rumor minded Twitter may be about to be acquired by Chipotle Mexican Grill That firm says that it s spending money on a big new advertising strategy There s no evidence that Chipotle s going to buy Twitter of course but a lot of rumors like that are gathering steam as the firm s stock price charges higher on Wednesday morning
