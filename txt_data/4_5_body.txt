Samsung is planning to announce the Galaxy Note 8 in August according to a new report from Reuters citing a source that claims to be familiar with the matter The Reuters report also claims that the Note 8 will feature a dual camera system and a slightly larger curved display than the Galaxy S8 Plus which is in line with rumors from earlier this year An August announcement would make sense as Samsung has announced previous Note devices including the Note 5 and the ill fated Note 7 in a similar time frame A late August release date would also mean that Samsung would have a chance to get its newest flagship device on the market before Apple s own upcoming iPhone 8
