I have in the past generally been bearish on Twitter TWTR and bullish on Facebook FB with occasional shifts from those stances for shorter term trades Both companies have reported within the last twenty four hours and even for a contrarian like me the combined reports give no reason to change my long term view If anything Facebook s continued growth as Twitter s monthly active user MAU number stalls just reemphasizes the differences At some point simple valuation will cause a correction in both stocks upward for TWTR and downward for FB but that point now looks to be a long way off When I first saw Twitter s headline numbers I was quite prepared to change my view of the stock A substantial beat on the top and bottom line seemed to address the company s biggest issue that of monetization The problem however was that the estimates that were beaten were awful in the first place Beating low expectations is I suppose better than the alternative but even so revenues of 574 million do not compare well to sales of around 602 million in the same quarter last year Despite that If Dorsey et al had delivered a beat accompanied by sustained user growth it would be a positive but that was far from the case Monthly active users flatlined coming in at the same as last quarter The company can point to a better daily active user number all it wants but consensus dictates that MAUs are the key metric for social media companies and any attempt to move the goalposts does not exactly inspire confidence Twitter is too much a part of the culture now to simply fade away so at some point the stock will represent value That however looks even further away today than it did yesterday The current forward P E of 43 don t forget is based on assumptions of user growth that will undoubtedly be revised downwards following this morning s release so P E will actually move higher despite the stock s big drop Who wants to pay a growth premium for a company whose growth has stopped Facebook on the other hand just goes from strength to strength On almost every metric they are Twitter s polar opposite They too beat on the top and bottom lines but while Twitter s revenues declined year on year Facebook posted massive growth going from just over 6 4 billion in the same quarter last year to over 9 3 billion this time around That kind of growth looks sustainable too Twitter s stagnant growth could be taken as an indication that traditional social media platforms in general are stalling but Facebook s performance shows that that is not the case They reported a seventeen percent increase in MAUs on a year to year basis That maintains their recent average which makes the disparity between the forward P Es of FB and TWTR even more remarkable As TWTR has shifted between failure to grow revenue and failure to grow users FB has expanded in both areas yet FB s forward P E is only 28 8 For a company that just reported forty five percent sales growth year on year that is a bargain I am by nature a contrarian so always tend to root for the underdog and for a while it looked as if Twitter may be finally getting it right They had shifted to concentrate on monetization and begun to move towards actual profitability which they achieved last quarter That is good news but when monetization comes at the cost of user growth it does not bode well for the future Facebook has shown that growing sales and users at the same time is quite possible and their ability to do that makes it clear once again that theirs is the stock for investors to be in while TWTR is still one to avoid
