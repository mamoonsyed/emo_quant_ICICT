Samsung s Galaxy Note 8 has officially arrived and is now available through carriers websites and in their physical stores Some preorder customers already received their phone orders but if you were waiting to actually check the device out in person now s your chance Samsung is charging 929 for an unlocked version However if you d rather finance a phone through your carrier T Mobile has the cheapest offer on the new device though not my much It costs 930 although the carrier is also offering it for a 210 down payment and 30 monthly installments with T Mobile s Equipment Installment Plan or for 0 down and 39 a month for Jump on Demand customers Your next best bet is AT T which is selling it for 949 99 or 31 67 for 30 months on an AT T Next installment plan Both Verizon and Sprint are selling it for 960 The Note 8 only comes in a 64GB version in the US in either black or gray If you were waiting to decide between the Note 8 and Apple s new iPhones now s probably the time to make that decision The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus preorder opened today with the phones expected to ship on September 22nd The pricy iPhone X won t be on sale until October 27th with a ship date of November 3rd I don t think these phones necessarily took away from the Note 8 s customer base as its stylus aka S Pen is its most defining feature and none of the iPhones include one Still the timing could have been a bit better on Samsung s part
