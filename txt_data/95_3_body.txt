Following a disappointing first quarter report in April International Business Machines NYSE IBM provided an encore performance on Tuesday A 4 7 year over year drop in revenue was worse than analysts were expecting with every segment reporting a decline IBM s strategic imperatives which includes growth businesses like cloud computing analytics and security grew sales by just 5 year over year or 7 adjusted for currency It wasn t all bad news IBM handily beat analyst estimates for earnings reporting adjusted EPS of 2 97 0 23 ahead of expectations The company also reiterated its full year guidance which calls for adjusted EPS of at least 13 80 and roughly flat free cash flow year over year IBM expects the second half of the year to be stronger than the first driven by service contract signings including a 1 7 billion cloud services deal with Lloyds the launch of the new IBM Z mainframe and an upcoming refresh of its Power servers IBM s mixed second quarter drew some analyst downgrades Cantor Fitzgerald kept the stock at neutral but knocked its price target down from 166 to 154 This comes a few days after Jefferies maintained its underperform rating on the stock but slashed its price target from 154 to 125 Here are a few key points from IBM s second quarter report The second quarter marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year over year revenue declines for IBM Currency played a role with revenue adjusted for currency declining by just 3 3 But this result continues a long streak that investors would no doubt like to forget One thing to remember about IBM is that revenue growth isn t the main goal CFO Martin Schroeter appearing on CNBC s Closing Bell on Tuesday reiterated this point It s easy to get revenue in an enterprise space It s finding the profit that we re focused on This is a similar statement as one made by IBM CEO Virginia Rometty during a conference in late 2015 In a market where tech companies with quick growth and big losses are given premium valuations IBM is a fish out of water Revenue growth will need to return before IBM stock can truly recover After a long streak of double digit growth IBM s growth businesses slowed down during the second quarter IBM s cloud computing business still produced double digit growth and its cloud as a service annual revenue run rate jumped 32 to 8 8 billion Over the past 12 months the cloud business produced 15 1 billion of revenue and the strategic imperatives accounted for 43 of IBM s total revenue IBM pointed out in its earnings presentation that growth in strategic imperatives reflected organic performance so the slowdown may be the result of acquisitions not contributing as much as they did in prior quarters Still the story at IBM is that these strategic imperatives will eventually return the company to growth so the end of double digit growth is at least a little concerning At the end of the day a company s value is based on its profits not its revenue IBM managed to grow its adjusted per share earnings during the second quarter producing EPS of 2 97 up about 1 year over year This puts the company on pace to hit its full year earnings guidance Unfortunately this earnings growth wasn t driven by the underlying business IBM reported a GAAP tax rate of 4 5 and a non GAAP tax rate of 9 2 both knocked down due to discrete tax benefits These benefits added 0 18 to the EPS The good news IBM would have still beaten analyst estimates even after backing out the lower tax rate The bad news earnings would have declined compared to the same period last year if not for the lower tax rate While IBM sees adjusted earnings per share rising this year that increase will be less meaningful for investors if it s not being driven by improvements in the business itself What s clear from the second quarter report is that IBM still has a lot of work to do The second half will look better than the first but the jury is still out on whether the company s transformation will ultimately be a success
