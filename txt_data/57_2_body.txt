We are pleased to report strong third quarter performance that delivered double digit overall organic growth driven by robust sales of innovative therapies Sales were in line with our expectations and were lifted by 20 percent global underlying growth in TAVR And we continue to aggressively pursue breakthrough structural heart therapies with the potential to drive significant future growth and help an even broader group of patients said Michael A Mussallem chairman and CEO While we are assisting a number of our employees who were personally affected by the recent natural disasters we were fortunate to have experienced minimal business impact Sales for the quarter ended September 30 2017 were 821 5 million up 11 1 percent Including the consumption of 17 0 million of stocking inventory in Germany adjusted sales were 838 5 million up 12 9 percent over the third quarter last year Net income for the quarter ended September 30 2017 was 170 1 million or 0 79 per share Adjusted EPS grew 23 5 percent to 0 84 Adjusted EPS would have been 0 88 this quarter based on the excess tax benefit estimated in previous guidance 2 For the quarter the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy THVT sales of 481 2 million a 17 3 percent growth rate over the third quarter last year Adjusted THVT sales were 498 2 million up 20 5 percent on an underlying basis Growth was strong both inside and outside the U S driven by continued therapy adoption and is consistent with the company s expectation of a 5 plus billion opportunity by 2021 The company recently introduced its CE Mark pending SAPIEN 3 Ultra System at the PCR London Valves meeting This system features advancements designed to help TAVR heart teams simplify procedures save time and reduce potential complications In the U S THVT sales for the quarter were 311 6 million a 20 1 percent growth rate over the third quarter last year Strong therapy adoption continued to fuel an increase in procedures broadly across our network of hospitals led by our best in class SAPIEN 3 valve said Mussallem Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales for the quarter were 195 6 million up 2 4 percent compared to the third quarter last year or up 2 2 percent on an underlying basis Growth was driven by strong performance of the INTUITY Elite valve system and solid growth in core products outside the U S This growth was partially offset by the continuing shift from the company s surgical aortic valves to SAPIEN 3 valves in the U S and Europe Critical Care sales were 144 7 million for the quarter representing an increase of 4 5 percent versus last year or 5 2 percent on an underlying basis This performance was driven by solid growth of core products and the Enhanced Surgical Recovery program particularly in the U S and Asia Pacific For the quarter the company s gross profit margin was 74 0 percent compared to 72 8 percent in the same period last year This improvement primarily reflects the benefit of a more profitable business mix led by growing sales of TAVR as well as a favorable comparison of supply chain expenses Partially offsetting these benefits were expenses associated with flooding from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the planned closure of the company s manufacturing plant in Switzerland Selling general and administrative expenses increased 6 5 percent to 244 6 million for the quarter This increase was driven by personnel and sales related expenses primarily in support of the transcatheter heart valve therapy product line Research and development investments for the third quarter increased 26 5 percent to 142 9 million This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in mitral and aortic transcatheter valve programs Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was 310 8 million After capital spending of 42 3 million free cash flow was 268 5 million Cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaled 1 4 billion at September 30 2017 Total debt was 1 0 billion For the full year 2017 the company reaffirmed its full year sales estimate at the high end of its 3 2 to 3 4 billion guidance and its estimate for 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 3 65 to 3 85 For the fourth quarter 2017 at current foreign exchange rates the company projects adjusted sales to be between 855 and 895 million and adjusted EPS to be between 0 84 and 0 94 We are very pleased

uses the term adjusted sales or underlying growth rate when referring to non GAAP sales information which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations adjustments for discontinued and acquired products sales return reserves associated with transcatheter heart valve therapy THVT product upgrades and the positive impact of THVT stocking sales in Germany and the negative impact of de stocking The Company uses the term adjusted to also exclude intellectual property litigation expenses amortization of intellectual property fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities arising

an underlying basis and projections for diluted earnings per share net income and growth gross profit margin taxes and free cash flow are also provided on a non GAAP basis as adjusted for the items identified below due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect timing and potential significance of special charges or gains and management s inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations after deducting payments for capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including among others investing in the Company s business making strategic acquisitions strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock Management uses non GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making forecasting future results and evaluating current performance These non GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company s operations by investors that when viewed with its GAAP results provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company s business and facilitate comparability to historical periods Non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP therefore the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to and not as a substitute for or superior
