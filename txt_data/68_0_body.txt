Qualcomm s stock tanked more than 12 on Monday The San Diego based chipmaker took a beating after Apple filed a lawsuit against the company on Friday suing the company for 1 billion and accusing it of unfairly charging royalties for technology it has nothing to do with What s more the United States Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm for antitrust violations just a few days earlier Wall Street analysts are still coming to terms with what this means for Qualcomm and things aren t looking good at this point On Monday Bernstein Research published a research note detailing the severity of the case against Qualcomm Apple s 1 billion demand is only a sideshow to the real issue at hand analysts Stacy Rasgon and Tony Sacconaghi wrote Rather what Apple is really trying to accomplish is a direct assault on Qualcomm s basic licensing business model the report said Qualcomm is the dominant supplier of modem chips that enable phones to connect to cellular networks but the company also extracts licensing fees for nearly every modern phone in the world Qualcomm charges phone makers for the entire device regardless of how much Qualcomm technology is actually in the device It s a nice business While selling the chips makes up the majority of Qualcomm s revenue 23 5 billion in 2016 licensing is the dominant source of its profits This model began back in 1990s when a much smaller Qualcomm pioneered CDMA or code division multiple access that became the industry standard in cellular Since then the amount of technology and components that companies like Apple pack into phone has grown by leaps and bounds but Apple still has to pay out the same percentage to Qualcomm Bernstein estimated that Apple has to pay 3 to 4 of the iPhone s bill of materials cost or 15 per phone It appears Apple is tired of paying this fee In the lawsuit Apple said it was paying between four and nine times the royalty rates that Kyocera Japanese maker of Android phones has to pay for a 100 phone Apple claimed Qualcomm hides behind a thicket of more than 30 000 patents to extort royalties Apple s lawsuit reads By leveraging the thicket Qualcomm attempts to avoid the patent by patent analysis that is ordinarily required for any licensing demand instead hiding behind the sheer volume of its patent portfolio to extort royalties from potential licensees Qualcomm plans to fight Apple s claims in court Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement issued Friday Qualcomm accused Apple of being behind various regulatory attacks against the company including the FTC suit Last month South Korea fined Qualcomm 890 million for what it described as monopolistic tactics Regulators at the European Union and in Taiwan are also investigating the company The Bernstein report also reads that Qualcomm s business of providing the actual modem chips to Apple is likely at stake now Apple said that Qualcomm had worked out an exclusivity arrangement between 2011 and 2016 where Apple would only use modem chips from Qualcomm in exchange for billions in rebates This cut out any potential competition Apple alleged Late last year however Qualcomm rival Intel became a modem provider for some versions of the iPhone 7 The Bernstein report speculated that Qualcomm could end up losing even more share in future Apple devices Qualcomm will report earnings on Wednesday this week and any results and guidance the company shares with investors will be virtually irrelevant the report warned Bernstein downgraded Qualcomm s stock from 80 a share to 65 Expect the overhang from what appears to be an all out attack on the business model from both regulators and largest customers will remain for quite some time the report said
