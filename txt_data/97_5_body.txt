In a more subdued environment for U S equities the very mixed set of sales earnings guidance and product order figures shared by Cisco Systems CSCO after the close on Wednesday might trigger some selling But with indices surging to new highs almost daily and Cisco despite its recent rally still trading at moderate multiples the networking giant apparently did enough to get a thumbs up from investors Cisco reported fiscal second quarter January quarter revenue of 11 58 billion down 2 annually and adjusted EPS of 0 57 slightly topping consensus analyst estimates of 11 55 billion and 0 56 April quarter guidance is for revenue to be flat to down 2 and for EPS to be in a range of 0 57 to 0 59 that s in line with consensus estimates for a 1 sales drop and EPS of 0 58 And as many expected given the company s history Cisco hiked its dividend raising its quarterly payout by 0 03 share to 0 29 share The forward yield stands at 3 5 Shares initially slipped a little following Cisco s earnings release but turned green after the company reported on its earnings call that product orders were flat last quarter after having dropped 2 during the October quarter The improvement seen in service provider orders they were down just 1 after falling 12 in the prior quarter seems to have been especially well received As of the time of publication Cisco shares were up 2 1 after hours to 33 52 reaching levels last seen in 2007 They still only trade for 13 5 times a pre earnings fiscal 2018 ends in July 2018 EPS consensus of 2 49 and that s before accounting for 37 billion in net cash mostly the result of a 62 billion offshore cash hoard on the balance sheet Though Q2 sales beat estimates Cisco s mainstay switching business was even weaker than expected with revenue dropping 5 to 3 3 billion 39 of product sales The company has blamed weak demand for the campus switches used to wire offices HP Enterprise HPE and Huawei have been competing aggressively in this space but it s hard to ignore the ongoing shift in IT spend towards cloud infrastructures that often use white label switches And looking ahead the adoption of third party software defined networking SDN platforms such as VMware s VMW NSX which is now a billion dollar revenue run rate could also be an issue Jim Cramer and the AAP team hold positions in Cisco and HP Enterprise for their Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells CSCO or HPE Learn more now
