driven by strong performance in Unified Threat Web Security and Advanced Threat which was partially offset by decline in legacy Firewall products The decline in switching revenues was primarily

Details Non GAAP gross margin contracted 100 basis points bps from the year ago quarter to 63 7 in the reported quarter The contraction can primarily be attributed to higher product gross margin down

bps and 20 bps respectively Non GAAP operating expenses as percentage of revenues decreased 110 bps to 32 2 primarily owing to decrease in most of the expense line items As a result operating margin expanded 10 bps to 31 5 Cisco s focus on driving cost improvement operational efficiencies and productivity helped in expanding operating margin Acquisitions Cisco completed the acquisition of

security market looks promising The company s security solutions continue to add customers Additionally the company s extended partnerships with Apple IBM and Microsoft will help it to gain significant traction in the cloud and Internet of Things IoT market space in the long run However weakness in the switching routing and data center businesses is significant headwind Moreover ongoing transition to subscription based model will continue to hurt top line Further weakness in the service provider business segment and intense competition from the likes of Huawei Juniper and Arista
