Shares of Nvidia NVDA are down 6 82 or almost 4 at 179 02 while shares of Advanced Micro Devices AMD are down 9 cents or half a percent at 13 65 as both stocks respond from the report late yesterday by CNBC that AMD has gotten some business from Tesla Motors TSLA to supply chips for autonomous driving Initial responses yesterday included a favorable view on AMD from Rosenblatt s Hans Mosesmann and a defense of Nvidia from RBC s Mitch Steves And the commentary keeps coming this morning On the skeptical front Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein sounds the most cautious note perhaps among sell side analysts He wonders if a whole bunch of things are being conflated about AMD its manufacturer Global Foundries and Tesla We note that the article began by citing supposed statements from GlobalFoundries CEO Sanjay Jha that Tesla was working directly with them on chips an assertion that GloFo later apparently indicated as being misreported Jha was supposedly making general statements about companies that have shown interest in working closely with silicon manufacturers and listed Tesla as an example And the rest of the article was vague citing only an unnamed source stating that the Tesla chips would be built on top of AMD intellectual property which is not quite the same as AMD making them Additionally the article also pointed to a number of true but functionally irrelevant linkages between the companies for example referring to GloFo as an AMD spin off calling out AMD s wafer supply agreement with GloFo and citing former AMD chief architect Jim Keller s leadership of Tesla s autopilot group as well as other recent AMD hires by the company Frankly we are wondering at the possibility that Tesla s hiring practices and Tesla s and AMD s separate engagements with GloFo could all be getting improperly convolved here Rasgon who has an Outperform rating on Nvidia shares and a Market Perform rating on AMD stock thinks if actually true such a report is an incremental negative for Nvidia but not thesis changing He sees little immediate benefit to AMD As far as AMD goes the company has been making efforts to build out their semicustom business for some time as well as looking for mechanisms to monetize their IP Given the vagueness of the article it remains unclear exactly what this is if anything at all but built on top of suggests something closer to the latter than the former to us likely more sensible given AMD s virtual absence from anything AI related and likely less lucrative if in fact it is real And even at a volume should TSLA reach it of several hundred thousand vehicles per year the potential opportunity for AMD even at say 100 per car likely extreme for an IP contribution is probably not nearly as large as other opportunities currently in front of them Jefferies Co s Mark Lipacis reiterating a Buy rating on AMD shares and a 19 price target writes that while not substantiated nevertheless a partnership between Tesla and AMD would make sense to us given that former chief AMD MPU architect Jim Keller designer of AMD s current Zen architecture left AMD to become Tesla s Head of Autopilot in early 2016 This could be a critical win for AMD We could see AMD s Semi Custom business model 25 30 GMs customer pays for R D as a unique component of the arrangement While we would not expect shipments of AMD chips to Tesla to have a material impact near term to AMD bottom line assume 200 AMD processor and 300K to 400K Tesla cars in 2018 would translate to 0 02 to 0 03 in EPS we think this would constitute a critical win for AMD as it would support our thesis that with its parallel processing GPUs AMD is a beneficiary of the 4th Tectonic Shift thesis Craig Ellis with B Riley Co reiterating a Buy rating on Nvidia shares and a 200 price target writes that this report is merely a headline at this point and not a meaningful fundamental risk for Nvidia s auto business We believe the development has potential to be a modest fundamental and psychological negative for NVDA in the intermediate term writes Ellis though believe the company remains the dominant autopilot solutions provider with a substantial competitive moat and very strong developer momentum Ellis notes Nvidia has plenty of business in autos More specifically we would be surprised if TSLA moved to an internal solution in the next year or perhaps two so NVDA C17 18 Auto Platform estimates seem to have little risk Further we remind investors NVDA s year to date autopilot partnership announcements with Mercedes Benz Toyota Volkswagen s Audi group and Volvo We expect additional auto manufacturer partnerships will be struck later in 2017 and 2018 and as that happens expect non recurring engineering NRE revenue will accelerate into C18 Production systems sales should become a more meaningful catalyst in C2H18 and CY19 More broadly NVDA is also engaged with PACCAR so is gaining trucking market traction Module supplier Bosch and a large number of CUDA software developers among others add to ecosystem breadth Summit Redstone s Kinngai Chan who considers Nvidia his top pick in semiconductor stocks writes that at less than 1 of Nvidia s total sales today We think investors should not react too negatively on this news Nvidia s chips will remain the dominant offering at Tesla he predicts While we do not have all the details of the performance features and launch timing of the actual product TSLA is working on we believe it s normal for a company like TSLA to try to reduce its dependence on a merchant CPU solution We however think the GPU remains the key enabler for level 5 autonomous driving along with the CPU similar to how NVDA s CGPUs are used today along with INTC s CPU for datacenter acceleration We believe this industry requirement continues to favor NVDA as NVDA core competence is the GPU While losing the CPU design to an in house solution may be viewed as negative we strongly believe NVDA will remain the GPU supplier of choice to TSLA for the foreseeable future For AMD Chan sees little immediate impact if the report is true We are unable to confirm that TSLA will be using AMD X86 semi custom ASIC similar to what AMD is providing Microsoft MSFT NR and SONY 6758 JP NR for their game consoles today In any case we think the ASP per chip may range from 100 200 but we think the unit volumes TSLA will be shipping are too low to be meaningful for AMD in the next 1 2 years While we do see some near term catalyst for AMD on the benefit of new PC client CPU APU product channel fill and demand strength for its GPU in the crypto currency mining market we expect more competitive pressure from INTC and NVDA as we move into 2018 As for Intel We do not see any meaningful changes in the competitive landscape for Mobileye and INTC writes Chan
