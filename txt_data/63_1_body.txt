27 HP s total revenue increased 3 6 year over year to 12 684 billion and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 774 billion The better than expected top line performance was driven mainly by

strength in Personal System and execution of restructuring actions and productivity initiatives However the company provided not so encouraging forthcoming and fiscal 2017 earnings guidance We are impressed by the performance of HP Inc s PC segment wherein the year over year increase was witnessed mainly due to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues HP s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable The company is working on product innovation and differentiation as well as enhancing the capabilities of the printing business to stabilize the top line Furthermore looking at the data compiled by two independent research firms Gartner and International Data Corporation we believe that the downtrend in PC shipments showed signs of stabilization in fourth quarter 2016 compared with the previous quarters Notably for HP this was the third consecutive quarter of year over year shipment growth following five back to back quarters of underperformance The company witnessed a 4 3 increase in PC shipments and raised its market share to 20 4 from 18 8 in the year ago quarter We believe that the company s ongoing restructuring initiatives will result in lower costs while enhancing both productivity and profitability However macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns Competition from the likes of International Business Machines
