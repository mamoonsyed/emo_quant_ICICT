The latest leak regarding AMD s long awaited Ryzen CPUs is perhaps the best yet we now perhaps have some idea of how the Ryzen 7 1700X performs against Intel s competition This is the CPU that many enthusiasts that own high end systems will likely opt for It s slated to be a 389 CPU that offers 8 cores and 16 threads with a turbo frequency of 3 8GHz The latest leaked benchmark results come via Xfastest com which reveal scores in the popular CPU benchmark Cinebench The price is key though while Intel Core i7 6900K is a little faster with both CPUs at stock speed remember that the specifications are similar as well with both CPUs sporting 8 cores and 16 threads plus similar clock speeds the Intel CPU costs a massive 1050 over on Newegg right now That s over two and half times more than the 389 the Ryzen 7 1700X has been rumored to cost at launch In the graph above I ve also added my own benchmark results for a number of CPUs including overclocked numbers for Intel CPUs plus the latest leaked Cinebench results for the Ryzen 5 1600X No one knows just how well the AMD CPUs will overclock and it s entirely possible that the Ryzen 7 1700X will leapfrog the Core i7 6900K entirely once overclocked The Ryzen 5 1600X is also a significant product in AMD s line up as it s the more powerful of two 6 core CPUs with 12 threads that will cost just 259 In the graph at the top of the page this is able to topple even a Core i7 7700K which I d overclocked to 5GHz and this is a more expensive CPU too The Ryzen 5 1600X wasn t quite able to topple the Core i7 6850K which has a similar core and thread count but again it s a question of price The Intel CPU costs over 600 while the Ryzen 5 1600X is meant to retail for less than 300 It s clear that in the price war even if we see prices close to these figures which should be taken with a generous pinch of salt AMD is heading towards a massive victory While Intel still seems to hold a slight lead in clock for clock performance this simply won t matter when people reach for their wallets given that AMD seems to be able to offer similar performance for a drastically reduced price tag Incidentally if you want to see how your PC fares against these latest figures head over to Maxon net and download Cinebench R15 then run the CPU test to get a comparable score
