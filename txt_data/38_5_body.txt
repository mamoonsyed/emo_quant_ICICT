Recently a reader posed a question on Advanced Micro Devices NYSE AMD In short the question was whether the fundamental data support the recent comeback the stock staged from when it was valued as a penny stock In other words is AMD trading on hype alone or do the fundamentals of the company show legitimate growth This question can be tackled from many angles I generally answer such questions by running the company s fundamentals through a gamut of metrics looking mainly for reliable trends Too often point calculations or estimates are improperly used when it is the trend that matters For AMD I believe the process applies here However I would like to spend some time also discussing the main catalyst for AMD s future Ryzen The new chip and an important fundamental metric are the two main foci of this analysis The metric EBITDA to EV is one of my favorite fundamental metrics because of it is one of the few metrics that shows statistical reliability in predicting future stock prices EBITDA divided by EV is a strong measurement of a company s ROI normalized over the industry thereby including the concept of opportunity cost But instead of looking at EBITDA to EV alone it is best to look at the trend it has taken over the years If we see a pattern it can be representative of the business momentum which certainly has implications for the stock If we were to look at this value for AMD we would see fluctuations all over the place It is only when we chart it do we see that AMD s ROI has been declining over the long term Oddly enough AMD seems to go through cycles of false comebacks Every few years or so ROI spikes and the stock soon follows But if we are to pay attention to the overall trend we actually see that these peaks have been lower each cycle This is a classic example of lower highs While the term lower highs generally is used in technical analysis to look at stock prices here I m targeting a fundamental ratio AMD s ability to profit from its enterprise value has been steadily dropping in spite of the cycles These cycles can easily be explained New chips are hyped by the company then by users and finally by investors who buy the stock in anticipation that these new chips will jump back into the industry eating some of the market currently grasped firmly by Intel NASDAQ INTC Our Location in the Cycle We are about at that point again in the cycle and I m afraid AMD is going to see another lower high with its new Ryzen line of chips Coming from a marketing background I was not impressed at first by AMD straddling two unique selling propositions for the chip cheap and fast Their best entry to market share is by choosing one route either by creating an entry level chip superior to Intel s or by outpricing Intel to cater to a price conscious market As more benchmarks are published investors can better understand the market AMD s Ryzen chips will attract The most recent benchmark looks quite good for AMD I must admit The 4 core Ryzen looks to be a decent competitor to Intel s dual core i3 At a similar price Ryzen will likely have a slight marketing edge because 4 is better than 2 But this depends on the target market which might be more niche than mainstream and therefore the 4 2 argument fails In addition Ryzen will run at 95W versus Intel s 140W Like the 4 vs 2 core issue this is not a huge deal but the lower power consumption could be a factor for power conscious buyers It also implies Ryzen to be quieter although we would need to test to call this a fact many heavy users such as myself do emphasize CPU noise during the purchase process I am in agreement that the recent news on the Ryzen chips have been supporting the hype but I still believe that management must play their hand correctly as even pocket aces do not guarantee a won pot The question now seems not to be whether AMD s chips are good but whether AMD can deliver AMD as a company is constantly aiming and hitting their targets but the company has not seen much relative success with their strategy as their targets are to be blunt the same targets Intel had years ago not now In other words AMD has been successful in following Intel s footsteps and beating them at their own game many years after the rules of the game has changed We won t see Intel produce a Ryzen killer for this precise reason Intel is a better forecaster of the future than is AMD and is preparing for the next wave of computing which will likely be an enhanced emphasis on GPUs for machine learning purposes This means competition with Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA not AMD If AMD takes a considerable chunk of the CPU market from Intel we can say that they ve won a battle but it s hard to say whether that battle was important in the long run Intel s newest CPU s are still slightly faster than AMD s newest next gen CPU so where does this position AMD in the market This goes back to the marketing question When you break down the fundamentals AMD can only follow in the tracks INTC has already cleared This does not mean AMD is a poor investment but in this industry profit follows innovations And when the fundamental patterns show weakening return on investment bullish investors on a lagging tech company tend to turn to the news to overinflate the features of the newest innovation I find the EBITDA EV pattern to be an important fundamental metric If we agree that Ryzen is not groundbreaking what reason could we possibly have to believe that the lower highs pattern in EBITDA EV will not continue What reason do we have to explain away the fact that we seem to be currently sitting in the hype phase before EBITDA EV peaks and then falls again It is tempting to say this time is different every time AMD releases something new but investors know that those four words can be extremely expensive when they are the main basis for an investment When I run a machine learning algorithm on AMD s history I also see support for the hype fall pattern every few years in AMD Or perhaps the Intel i5 chip my computer used to process the above graph is biased That s a joke The truth I believe is almost always in the data and in this case the data show AMD to be ready for another post hype slide I want to close this article with an important personal note I am not anti AMD I would love AMD to succeed and bring more competition to the market My viewpoint is that Intel s profit relies too heavily on price gouging and that true competition would be better for everyone except INTC of course However if AMD s Ryzen line does actually pose a threat to Intel Intel will most likely respond by cutting its prices down to directly compete The result won t be a breakthrough for AMD but a mere ability to compete I want AMD to succeed but I simply don t see it happening AMD s fundamental and technical path is downward and I see that path to be justified by a lack of innovation and a huge competitor who could easily respond to any threat AMD could produce The short lived victory of AMD over Intel two decades ago is likely to be seen again in Ryzen If you want to invest in a comeback AMD is not your stock In regard to AMD s stock at best Ryzen is the next in an increasingly weak series of bounces Note Get my articles as soon as they are published by clicking the big orange follow button at the top of this page Make sure you choose real time alerts Trade
