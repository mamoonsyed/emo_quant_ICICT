Amazon com Inc has been riding high the past few months sending its market cap and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos s net worth to record levels But the company s free spending ways took a big hit out of profit at the same time Amazon s earnings plunged 77 in the second quarter as operating expenses jumped across the board leading to its lowest quarterly net income since the third quarter of 2015 Expenses increased 28 2 from the same quarter a year ago and 7 5 from the quarter before the type of spending increase Amazon usually sees in the second half of the year as it ramps up for and handles holiday shopping orders It doesn t seem that Amazon just shifted typical second half spending to earlier in the year though The company s forecast suggests that spending will continue to grow in the second half of the year as Amazon s revenue guidance for the third quarter is in line with expectations but projected income is much lower Amazon s stock price suffered Thursday evening declining more than 3 in late trading after running up 13 9 in the past 3 months as the S P 500 index gained 3 6 The first question and many that followed for Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky in Thursday s conference call was about spending and he did not shirk from the fact that Amazon will ramp up spending in the second half of the year as usual He noted that new fulfillment centers will be coming online in the second half many in the third quarter and that spending on video content will increase from last year and even the first half of this year Those two areas were already large expenses for Amazon but they received an extra boost in the second quarter as spending on fulfillment grew about 33 and technology and content spending rose about 43 from a year ago One specific area that Olsavsky noted was the expansion of Amazon Web Services the company s cloud computing offering which required a big boost in capital leases even as AWS has cut prices Property and equipment acquired under capital lease jumped more than 90 year over year and more than 40 from the first quarter to 2 72 billion in the quarter Don t miss All the companies in Jeff Bezos s empire in one large chart We ve really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion Olsavsky said Amazon is also spending on new employees Bezos said in the earnings release that Amazon has hired more than 30 000 new employees in the last few months and Olsavsky noted that Amazon has been bringing on software engineers and advertising personnel for AWS that have helped boost Amazon s workforce by 42 in the past year That growth also doesn t appear ready to slow down as Amazon plans its first job fair next month while looking to fill about 50 000 open positions Read also One way other companies may survive Amazon s onslaught Amazon has never been one to shy away from spending heavily on investments for the long term and the targets for its second quarter checkbook AWS expansion the fulfillment network video content for its Prime streaming offering and employees to support those and other efforts fit the pattern Longtime Amazon investors and observers were not shocked to see that profit took a hit from spending as its been a common refrain and it is unlikely to change their outlook on the company in the negative This is a known pattern for Amazon The company posts strong sales increases in both e commerce and AWS and is not afraid to spend that money at a similar rate in order to build for the future Expect more in the second half of the year and beyond Amazon shares have gained 39 in 2017 while the S P 500 SPX 0 81 has gained 11
