IRVINE Calif April 25 2017 PRNewswire Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW the global leader in patient focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31 2017 Our first quarter continued a trend of exceptional growth for Edwards at both the top and bottom lines said Michael A Mussallem chairman and CEO Strong total sales growth of 19 percent on an underlying basis was above our expectations and reflected strength in all three of our product lines across all regions with particular strength in transcatheter heart valves in the U S We re also pleased with our progress on key R D milestones as we pursue innovative solutions for the patients we serve First Quarter 2017 Results Sales for the quarter ended March 31 2017 were 883 5 million up 26 7 percent which included 61 8 million of Germany stocking sales On an underlying basis sales grew 19 1 percent over the first quarter last year Underlying sales growth excludes the impact of the Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation Net income for the quarter ended March 31 2017 was 230 2 million or 1 06 per share Adjusted earnings per share grew 32 percent to 0 94 For the quarter the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy THVT sales of 539 2 million a 46 6 percent growth rate over the first quarter last year or 31 8 percent on an underlying basis Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies In the U S THVT sales for the quarter were 298 8 million a 38 1 percent growth rate over the first quarter last year or 39 2 percent on an underlying basis Therapy adoption this quarter was strong with continued growth in procedures across more than 500 hospitals This growth continues to be driven by the extraordinary performance of our SAPIEN 3 valve and the growing body of evidence that supports excellent patient outcomes and faster recovery said Mussallem Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales for the quarter were 199 5 million up 1 8 percent compared to the first quarter last year or up 2 6 percent on an underlying basis This was driven by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve Critical Care sales were 144 8 million for the quarter representing an increase of 8 4 percent versus last year or 8 5 percent on an underlying basis Solid growth across all product categories was led by double digit growth in the company s Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program and a lift from a U S bulk order For the quarter the company s gross profit margin was 75 6 percent compared to 74 1 percent in the same period last year This increase was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange Selling general and administrative expenses increased to 229 6 million for the quarter compared to 212 7 million in the prior year quarter This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses relating to transcatheter valves Research and development investments for the first quarter increased to 128 7 million compared to 101 8 million in the prior year period This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in transcatheter aortic and mitral valve programs including the recent acquisition of Valtech Cardio Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was 128 3 million After capital spending of 15 9 million free cash flow was 112 4 million Cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaled 918 2 million at March 31 2017 Total debt was 847 9 million During the first quarter the company repurchased 4 6 million shares for 437 4 million to help offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition and stock based incentive compensation Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were 216 4 million Outlook For the full year 2017 given the strong start to the year the company is narrowing its full year sales guidance to 3 2 to 3 4 billion from 3 0 to 3 4 billion The company is also raising its estimate for 2017 adjusted earnings per share to 3 43 to 3 55 from 3 30 to 3 45 For the second quarter of 2017 the company projects sales excluding the impact of Germany stocking sales to be between 810 and 850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 0 82 to 0 92 Our strong start to 2017 bolsters our confidence in our focused innovation strategy said Mussallem We believe

Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more meaningful comparison to historical financial results The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an underlying basis and projections for diluted earnings per share net income and growth gross profit margin taxes and free cash flow are also provided on a non GAAP basis as adjusted for the items identified below due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect timing and potential significance of special charges or gains and management s inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations after deducting payments for capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including among others investing in the Company s business making strategic acquisitions strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock Management uses non GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making forecasting future results and evaluating current performance These non GAAP financial measures
