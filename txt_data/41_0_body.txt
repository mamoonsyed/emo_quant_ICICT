Shares of Advanced Micro Devices AMD are down 45 cents or 3 2 at 13 35 after Barclays s Blayne Curtis this morning cut his rating on the shares to Underweight from Neutral after concluding the company s products including its Epyc server chip unveiled in May won t be enough to be competitive After seeing the launch of Purley and Epyc along with some third party benchmarks we believe the rubber is meeting the road and are unconvinced AMD products will gain enough traction to support the current valuation 45x forward P E writes Curtis Expensive even on 0 75 LT EPS target which we have difficulty getting anywhere near This is against a backdrop of what Curtis expects to be continued strength from the chip makers this year driven by things such as data center construction Tech broadly outperformed the S P see Figure 3 with Semis showing particular strength as multiple trends boost various end markets In the data center 25 100G begins to ramp in the 2H and server spend is expected to increase in the 2H on top of excitement around AI For Analog Industrial names demand continues to be high as shown by strong underlying PMI data and RF players benefit from optimism around the upcoming iPhone cycle PC and memory trends also continue to be better We look for continued strength from Semis into the 2H Curtis argues that deals announced with the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE don t actually mean there s that much interest in Epyc After the launch of both Purley and Epyc and seeing third party benchmarks for both we believe the rubber is meeting the road and gain conviction Epyc will not gain enough traction to support current valuation We have conducted regular channel checks since the fall and are still hearing little to no material traction at the ODMs which is the ultimate gauge of success This corroborates feedback from our last trip to Asia in March see March 2017 Asia Trip Takeaways 16 Mar 2017 when we heard there was little demand from hyperscale customers outside of some limited interest in China We do hear of some interest from OEMs such as HP and Dell but would add 1 OEMs having a sku does not mean demand is there and 2 Enterprises typically take a year plus to evaluate chips and likely longer in this case given the new design for AMD and lack of ecosystem He also thinks the bull argument that the company should benefit with just 10 market share underestimates how hard it is to get even 10 market share The simplistic math would suggest that if AMD has a useable CPU that 10 share is possible by just showing up First the last time AMD gained material share they 1 had a far superior product but that is not the case this time and 2 the AMD ecosystem is non existent this time around We would also highlight that Enterprises take a longer time to adopt a CPU telecom and HPC are likely out of reach for AMD for now so really 10 of total servers is really saying AMD captures 30 of the cloud which we see as unlikely He describes the appeal of Intel INTC remains our very controversial Top Pick see America s Top Picks 26 June 2017 despite sentiment as we believe the company can return to growth on better PC trends now less than 50 of revenue sustained DCG growth even at closer to a 10 CAGR and diversification Memory Mobile win all AAPL in 18 IoT and Autos Intel is also one of the cheapest in our universe 14x CY18E EV FCF vs Large Cap Median 17x 3 div yield and would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of proposed changes to the US corporate tax code
